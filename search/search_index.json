So far, nothing unusual. But little did you know, within the next five days, they would redefine not only mobile application security, but the very fundamentals of book writing itself (ironically, the event took place near Bletchley Park, once the residence and work place of the great Alan Turing).</p> <p>Or maybe that's going too far. But at least, they produced a proof-of-concept for an unusual security book. The Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) is an open, agile, crowd-sourced effort, made of the contributions of dozens of authors and reviewers from all over the world.</p> <p>Because this isn't a normal security book, the introduction doesn't list impressive facts and data proving importance of mobile devices in this day and age. It also doesn't explain how mobile application security is broken, and why a book like this was sorely needed, and the authors don't thank their beloved ones without whom the book wouldn't have been possible.</p> <p>We do have a message to our readers however! The first rule of the OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide is: Don't just follow the OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide. True excellence at mobile application security requires a deep understanding of mobile operating systems, coding, network security, cryptography, and a whole lot of other things, many of which we can only touch on briefly in this book. Don't stop at security testing. Write your own apps, compile your own kernels, dissect mobile malware, learn how things tick. And as you keep learning new things, consider contributing to the MASTG yourself!

The Testing Guide maps to the same basic set of security requirements offered by the MASVS and depending on the context, they can be used individually or combined to achieve different objectives.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, the MASVS requirements can be used in an app's planning and architecture design stages while the checklist and testing guide may serve as a baseline for manual security testing or as a template for automated security tests during or after development.

And since mobile devices are more likely to be or lost or stolen, attackers can actually gain physical access to the device, which would make it easier to retrieve the data.</p> <p>Thus we must take extra care to protect stored user data in mobile apps. Some solutions may include appropriate key storage APIs and using hardware-backed security features (when available).</p> <p>Fragmentation is a problem we deal with especially on Android devices. Not every Android device offers hardware-backed secure storage, and many devices are running outdated versions of Android.

While this allows for a quicker login and better user experience (nobody likes to enter complex passwords), it also introduces additional complexity and room for error.</p> <p>Mobile app architectures also increasingly incorporate authorization frameworks (such as OAuth2) that delegate authentication to a separate service or outsource the authentication process to an authentication provider.

At the time of publication, the Android and iOS operating systems cumulatively comprise more than 99% of the mobile OS market share and mobile Internet usage has surpassed desktop usage for the first time in history. This means that mobile apps are the most widespread types of Internet-capable apps.</p> <p>Also, this guide uses the term \"app\" as a general term which refers to any kind of application that runs on a mobile OS. Usually, apps run directly on the platform for which they\u2019re designed, run on top of a smart device\u2019s mobile browser, or they use a mix of these two methods. In this chapter, we will develop a mobile app taxonomy which will fit all apps into categories then discuss the variations of each app category.</p> <p>We place mobile apps into four categories:</p> <ul> <li>Native Apps</li> <li>Web Apps</li> <li>Hybrid Apps</li> <li>Progressive Web Apps</li> </ul>","tags":[]},{"location":"MASTG/0x04a-Mobile-App-Taxonomy/#native-apps","title":"Native Apps","text":"<p>If a mobile app is developed with a Software Development Kit (SDK) for developing apps specific to a mobile OS, they are referred to as native to their OS. If we are discussing a native app, we presume is was implemented in a standard programming language for that mobile operating system - Objective-C or Swift for iOS, and Java or Kotlin for Android.</p> <p>Because they are designed for a specific OS with the tools meant for that OS, native apps have the capability to provide the fastest performance with the highest degree of reliability. They usually adhere to platform-specific design principles (e.g. the Android Design Principles), which usually leads to a more consistent user interface (UI) compared to hybrid or web apps. Due to their close integration with the operating system, native apps generally can directly access almost every component of the device (camera, sensors, hardware-backed key stores, etc.).</p> <p>However, since Android provides two development kits - the Android SDK and the Android NDK, there is some ambiguity to the term native apps for this platform. While the SDK (based on the Java and Kotlin programming language) is the default for developing apps, the platform's NDK (or Native Development Kit) is a C/C++ kit used for developing binary libraries that can directly access lower level APIs (such as OpenGL). These libraries can be included in regular apps built with the SDK. Therefore, we say that Android native apps (i.e. built with the SDK) may have native code built with the NDK.</p> <p>The most obvious disadvantage of native apps is that they are limited to one specific platform. If developers want to build their app for both Android and iOS, one needs to maintain two independent code bases, or introduce often complex development tools to port a single code base to two platforms.</p> <p>Here are some multi-platform frameworks that allow developers to compile a single codebase for both Android and iOS:</p> <ul> <li>Xamarin</li> <li>Google Flutter</li> <li>React Native</li> </ul> <p>If an app is developed using these these frameworks, the app will use the internal APIs native to each system and offer performance equivalent to native apps.

Launcher icons may be used to parallel the same feel of accessing a native app; however, these icons are essentially the same as a browser bookmark, simply opening the default web browser to load the referenced web page.</p> <p>Because they run within the confines of a browser, web apps have limited integration with the general components of the device (i.e. they are \"sandboxed\") and their performance is usually inferior compared to native apps. Since developers usually target multiple platforms with a web app, their UIs generally do not follow the design principles of any specific platform. However, web apps are popular because developers can use a single code base to reduce development and maintenance costs and distribute updates without going through the platform-specific app stores. For example, a change to the HTML file for a web app can serve as viable, cross-platform update whereas an update to a store-based app requires considerably more effort.</p>","tags":[]},{"location":"MASTG/0x04a-Mobile-App-Taxonomy/#hybrid-apps","title":"Hybrid Apps","text":"<p>Hybrid apps try to benefit from the best aspects of native and web apps.

This automation is embodied in the deployment pipeline with the concepts of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).</p> <p>People may assume that the term \"DevOps\" represents collaboration between development and operations teams only, however, as DevOps thought leader Gene Kim puts it: \"At first blush, it seems as though the problems are just between Devs and Ops, but test is in there, and you have information security objectives, and the need to protect systems and data. These are top-level concerns of management, and they have become part of the DevOps picture.\"</p> <p>In other words, DevOps collaboration includes quality teams, security teams, and many other teams related to the project. When you hear \"DevOps\" today, you should probably be thinking of something like DevOpsQATestInfoSec. Indeed, DevOps values pertain to increasing not only speed but also quality, security, reliability, stability, and resilience.</p> <p>Security is just as critical to business success as the overall quality, performance, and usability of an app. As development cycles are shortened and delivery frequencies increased, making sure that quality and security are built in from the very beginning becomes essential. DevSecOps is all about adding security to DevOps processes. Most defects are identified during production. DevOps specifies best practices for identifying as many defects as possible early in the life cycle and for minimizing the number of defects in the released app.</p> <p>However, DevSecOps is not just a linear process oriented towards delivering the best possible software to operations; it is also a mandate that operations closely monitor software that's in production to identify issues and fix them by forming a quick and efficient feedback loop with development. DevSecOps is a process through which Continuous Improvement is heavily emphasized.</p> <p></p> <p>The human aspect of this emphasis is reflected in the creation of cross-functional teams that work together to achieve business outcomes.

Release candidates are evaluated by the deployment pipeline for conformity to standards they must fulfill for deployment to production.</p> <p>The commit phase is designed to provide instant feedback to developers and is therefore run on every commit to the trunk. Time constraints exist because of this frequency. The commit phase should usually be complete within five minutes, and it shouldn't take longer than ten.

The fact that many mobile apps implement defenses against unwelcome tampering doesn't make things easier for security testers.</p> <p>Reverse engineering a mobile app is the process of analyzing the compiled app to extract information about its source code. The goal of reverse engineering is comprehending the code.</p> <p>Tampering is the process of changing a mobile app (either the compiled app or the running process) or its environment to affect its behavior.

To enable black-box testing of mobile apps. Modern apps often include controls that will hinder dynamic analysis. SSL pinning and end-to-end (E2E) encryption sometimes prevent you from intercepting or manipulating traffic with a proxy. Root detection could prevent the app from running on a rooted device, preventing you from using advanced testing tools. You must be able to deactivate these defenses.</p> <p>2. To enhance static analysis in black-box security testing. In a black-box test, static analysis of the app bytecode or binary code helps you understand the internal logic of the app. It also allows you to identify flaws such as hardcoded credentials.</p> <p>3. To assess resilience against reverse engineering. Apps that implement the software protection measures listed in the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard Anti-Reversing Controls (MASVS-R) should withstand reverse engineering to a certain degree. To verify the effectiveness of such controls, the tester may perform a resilience assessment as part of the general security test. For the resilience assessment, the tester assumes the role of the reverse engineer and attempts to bypass defenses.</p> <p>Before we dive into the world of mobile app reversing, we have some good news and some bad news. Let's start with the good news:</p> <p>Ultimately, the reverse engineer always wins.</p> <p>This is particularly true in the mobile industry, where the reverse engineer has a natural advantage: the way mobile apps are deployed and sandboxed is by design more restrictive than the deployment and sandboxing of classical Desktop apps, so including the rootkit-like defensive mechanisms often found in Windows software (e.g., DRM systems) is simply not feasible. The openness of Android allows reverse engineers to make favorable changes to the operating system, aiding the reverse engineering process. iOS gives reverse engineers less control, but defensive options are also more limited.</p> <p>The bad news is that dealing with multi-threaded anti-debugging controls, cryptographic white-boxes, stealthy anti-tampering features, and highly complex control flow transformations is not for the faint-hearted. The most effective software protection schemes are proprietary and won't be beaten with standard tweaks and tricks. Defeating them requires tedious manual analysis, coding, frustration and, depending on your personality, sleepless nights and strained relationships.</p> <p>It's easy for beginners to get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of reversing. The best way to get started is to set up some basic tools (see the relevant sections in the Android and iOS reversing chapters) and start with simple reversing tasks and crackmes. You'll need to learn about the assembler/bytecode language, the operating system, obfuscations you encounter, and so on. Start with simple tasks and gradually level up to more difficult ones.</p> <p>In the following section, we'll give an overview of the techniques most commonly used in mobile app security testing.

These tools give you direct access to process memory and important structures such as live objects instantiated by the app. They come with many utility functions that are useful for resolving loaded libraries, hooking methods and native functions, and more. Process memory tampering is more difficult to detect than file patching, so it is the preferred method in most cases.</p> <p>Substrate, Frida, and Xposed are the most widely used hooking and code injection frameworks in the mobile industry. The three frameworks differ in design philosophy and implementation details: Substrate and Xposed focus on code injection and/or hooking, while Frida aims to be a full-blown \"dynamic instrumentation framework\", incorporating code injection, language bindings, and an injectable JavaScript VM and console.</p> <p>However, you can also instrument apps with Substrate by using it to inject Cycript, the programming environment (aka \"Cycript-to-JavaScript\" compiler) authored by Saurik of Cydia fame. To complicate things even more, Frida's authors also created a fork of Cycript called \"frida-cycript\". It replaces Cycript's runtime with a Frida-based runtime called Mj\u00f8lner. This enables Cycript to run on all the platforms and architectures maintained by frida-core (if you are confused at this point, don't worry). The release of frida-cycript was accompanied by a blog post by Frida's developer Ole titled \"Cycript on Steroids\", a title that Saurik wasn't very fond of.</p> <p>We'll include examples of all three frameworks.

Symbolic \"execution\" actually refers to the process of representing possible paths through a program as formulas in first-order logic. Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are used to check the satisfiability of these formulas and provide solutions, including concrete values of the variables needed to reach a certain point of execution on the path corresponding to the solved formula.</p> <p>In simple words, symbolic execution is mathematically analyzing a program without executing it. During analysis, each unknown input is represented as a mathematical variable (a symbolic value), and hence all the operations performed on these variables are recorded as a tree of operations (aka. AST (abstract syntax tree), from compiler theory). These ASTs can be translated into so-called constraints that will be interpreted by a SMT solver. In the end of this analysis, a final mathematical equation is obtained, in which the variables are the inputs whose values are not known. SMT solvers are special programs which solve these equations to give possible values for the input variables given a final state.</p> <p>To illustrate this, imagine a function which takes one input (<code>x</code>) and multiplies it by the value of a second input (<code>y</code>). Finally, there is an if condition which checks if the value calculated is greater than the value of an external variable(<code>z</code>), and returns \"success\" if true, else returns \"fail\". The equation for this operation will be <code>(x * y) &gt; z</code>.</p> <p>If we want the function to always return \"success\" (final state), we can tell the SMT solver to calculate the values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> (input variables) which satisfy the corresponding equation. As is the case for global variables, their value can be changed from outside this function, which may lead to different outputs whenever this function is executed. This adds to additional complexity in determining correct solution.</p> <p>Internally SMT solvers use various equation solving techniques to generate solution for such equations. Some of the techniques are very advanced and their discussion is beyond the scope of this book.</p> <p>In a real world situation, the functions are much more complex than the above example. The increased complexity of the functions can pose significant challenges for classical symbolic execution. Some of the challenges are summarised below:</p> <ul> <li>Loops and recursions in a program may lead to infinite execution tree.</li> <li>Multiple conditional branches or nested conditions may lead to path explosion.</li> <li>Complex equations generated by symbolic execution may not be solvable by SMT solvers because of their limitations.</li> <li>Program is using system calls, library calls or network events which cannot be handled by symbolic execution.</li> </ul> <p>To overcome these challenges, typically, symbolic execution is combined with other techniques such as dynamic execution (also called concrete execution) to mitigate the path explosion problem specific to classical symbolic execution. This combination of concrete (actual) and symbolic execution is referred to as concolic execution\u00a0(the name concolic stems from concrete and symbolic), sometimes also called as dynamic symbolic execution.</p> <p>To visualize this, in the above example, we can obtain the value of the external variable by performing further reverse engineering or by dynamically executing the program and feeding this information into our symbolic execution analysis. This extra information will reduce the complexity of our equations and may produce more accurate analysis results. Together with improved SMT solvers and current hardware speeds, concolic execution allows to explore paths in medium-size software modules (i.e., on the order of 10 KLOC).</p> <p>In addition, symbolic execution also comes in handy for supporting de-obfuscation tasks, such as simplifying control flow graphs. For example, Jonathan Salwan and Romain Thomas have shown how to reverse engineer VM-based software protections using Dynamic Symbolic Execution [#salwan] (i.e., using a mix of actual execution traces, simulation, and symbolic execution).</p> <p>In the Android section, you'll find a walkthrough for cracking a simple license check in an Android application using symbolic execution.</p>","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","all"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x04c-Tampering-and-Reverse-Engineering/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>[#vadla] Ole Andr\u00e9 Vadla Ravn\u00e5s, Anatomy of a code tracer - https://medium.com/@oleavr/anatomy-of-a-code-tracer-b081aadb0df8</li> <li>[#salwan] Jonathan Salwan and Romain Thomas, How Triton can help to reverse virtual machine based software protections - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EzuddBA61jEMy8XbjQKFF3jyoKwW7tLq/view?usp=sharing</li> </ul>","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","all"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x04e-Testing-Authentication-and-Session-Management/","title":"Mobile App Authentication Architectures","text":"<p>Authentication and authorization problems are prevalent security vulnerabilities.

While the backend service is processing requests from the mobile client, it must consistently enforce authorization checks: verifying that the user is logged in and authorized every time a resource is requested.</p> <p>Consider the following example from the OWASP Web Testing Guide. In the example, a web resource is accessed through a URL, and the authentication state is passed through a GET parameter:</p> <pre><code>http://www.site.com/page.asp?authenticated=no\n</code></pre> <p>The client can arbitrarily change the GET parameters sent with the request.

They assume that these parameters can't be tampered with. Consider, for example, the following classic vulnerability in Nortel Contact Center Manager. The administrative web application of Nortel's appliance relied on the cookie \"isAdmin\" to determine whether the logged-in user should be granted administrative privileges. Consequently, it was possible to get admin access by simply setting the cookie value as follows:</p> <pre><code>isAdmin=True\n</code></pre> <p>Security experts used to recommend using session-based authentication and maintaining session data on the server only. This prevents any form of client-side tampering with the session state. However, the whole point of using stateless authentication instead of session-based authentication is to not have session state on the server. Instead, state is stored in client-side tokens and transmitted with every request. In this case, seeing client-side parameters such as <code>isAdmin</code> is perfectly normal.</p> <p>To prevent tampering cryptographic signatures are added to client-side tokens. Of course, things may go wrong, and popular implementations of stateless authentication have been vulnerable to attacks.

This can be done in two different ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>With stateful authentication, a unique session id is generated when the user logs in.

The most commonly used token format is the JSON Web Token, defined in RFC7519. A JWT may encode the complete session state as a JSON object. Therefore, the server doesn't have to store any session data or authentication information.</p> <p>JWT tokens consist of three Base64Url-encoded parts separated by dots. The Token structure is as follows:</p> <pre><code>base64UrlEncode(header).base64UrlEncode(payload).base64UrlEncode(signature)\n</code></pre> <p>The following example shows a Base64Url-encoded JSON Web Token:</p> <pre><code>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6Ikpva\nG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ\n</code></pre> <p>The header typically consists of two parts: the token type, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm being used to compute the signature. In the example above, the header decodes as follows:</p> <pre><code>{\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"typ\":\"JWT\"}\n</code></pre> <p>The second part of the token is the payload, which contains so-called claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional metadata. For example:</p> <pre><code>{\"sub\":\"1234567890\",\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"admin\":true}\n</code></pre> <p>The signature is created by applying the algorithm specified in the JWT header to the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret value. For example, when using the HMAC SHA256 algorithm the signature is created in the following way:</p> <pre><code>HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + \".\" + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the secret is shared between the authentication server and the backend service - the client does not know it. This proves that the token was obtained from a legitimate authentication service. It also prevents the client from tampering with the claims contained in the token.</p> <p>Best Practices:</p> <p>Verify that the implementation adheres to JWT best practices:</p> <ul> <li>Verify that the HMAC is checked for all incoming requests containing a token.</li> <li>Verify that the private signing key or HMAC secret key is never shared with the client. It should be available for the issuer and verifier only.</li> <li>Verify that no sensitive data, such as personal identifiable information, is embedded in the JWT. For example, by decoding the base64-encoded JWT and find out what kind of data it transmits and whether that data is encrypted. If, for some reason, the architecture requires transmission of such information in the token, make sure that payload encryption is being applied. See the sample Java implementation on the OWASP JWT Cheat Sheet.</li> <li>Make sure that replay attacks are addressed with the <code>jti</code> (JWT ID) claim, which gives the JWT a unique identifier.</li> <li>Make sure that cross service relay attacks are addressed with the <code>aud</code> (audience) claim, which defines for which application the token is entitled.</li> <li>Verify that tokens are stored securely on the mobile phone, with, for example, KeyChain (iOS) or KeyStore (Android).</li> <li>Verify that the hashing algorithm is enforced. A common attack includes altering the token to use an empty signature (e.g., signature = \"\") and set the signing algorithm to <code>none</code>, indicating that \"the integrity of the token has already been verified\". Some libraries might treat tokens signed with the <code>none</code> algorithm as if they were valid tokens with verified signatures, so the application will trust altered token claims.</li> <li>Verify that tokens include an \"exp\" expiration claim and the backend doesn't process expired tokens. A common method of granting tokens combines access tokens and refresh tokens. When the user logs in, the backend service issues a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token.

Below you will find a list of some related threats and suggestions to avoid successful attacks on SMS-OTP.</p> <p>Threats:</p> <ul> <li>Wireless Interception: The adversary can intercept SMS messages by abusing femtocells and other known vulnerabilities in the telecommunications network.</li> <li>Trojans: Installed malicious applications with access to text messages may forward the OTP to another number or backend.</li> <li>SIM SWAP Attack: In this attack, the adversary calls the phone company, or works for them, and has the victim's number moved to a SIM card owned by the adversary. If successful, the adversary can see the SMS messages which are sent to the victim's phone number. This includes the messages used in the two-factor authentication.</li> <li>Verification Code Forwarding Attack: This social engineering attack relies on the trust the users have in the company providing the OTP. In this attack, the user receives a code and is later asked to relay that code using the same means in which it received the information.</li> <li>Voicemail: Some two-factor authentication schemes allow the OTP to be sent through a phone call when SMS is no longer preferred or available. Many of these calls, if not answered, send the information to voicemail. If an attacker was able to gain access to the voicemail, they could also use the OTP to gain access to a user's account.</li> </ul> <p>You can find below several suggestions to reduce the likelihood of exploitation when using SMS for OTP:</p> <ul> <li>Messaging: When sending an OTP via SMS, be sure to include a message that lets the user know 1) what to do if they did not request the code 2) your company will never call or text them requesting that they relay their password or code.</li> <li>Dedicated Channel: When using the OS push notification feature (APN on iOS and FCM on Android), OTPs can be sent securely to a registered application. This information is, compared to SMS, not accessible by other applications. Alternatively of a OTP the push notification could trigger a pop-up to approve the requested access.  </li> <li>Entropy: Use authenticators with high entropy to make OTPs harder to crack or guess and use at least 6 digits. Make sure that digits are separates in smaller groups in case people have to remember them to copy them to your app.</li> <li>Avoid Voicemail: If a user prefers to receive a phone call, do not leave the OTP information as a voicemail.</li> </ul> <p>SMS-OTP Research:</p> <ul> <li>[#dmitrienko] Dmitrienko, Alexandra, et al. \"On the (in) security of mobile two-factor authentication.\" International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security.

Confidentiality involves ensuring data privacy through the use of encryption. Data integrity deals with data consistency and detection of tampering and modification of data through the use of hashing. Authenticity ensures that the data comes from a trusted source.</p> <p>Encryption algorithms converts plaintext data into cipher text that conceals the original content. Plaintext data can be restored from the cipher text through decryption. Encryption can be symmetric (encryption/decryption with same secret-key) or asymmetric (encryption/decryption using a public and private key pair). In general, encryption operations do not protect integrity, but some symmetric encryption modes also feature that protection.</p> <p>Symmetric-key encryption algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption. This type of encryption is fast and suitable for bulk data processing. Since everybody who has access to the key is able to decrypt the encrypted content, this method requires careful key management and centralized control over key distribution.</p> <p>Public-key encryption algorithms operate with two separate keys: the public key and the private key. The public key can be distributed freely while the private key shouldn't be shared with anyone. A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key and vice-versa. Since asymmetric encryption is several times slower than symmetric operations, it's typically only used to encrypt small amounts of data, such as symmetric keys for bulk encryption.</p> <p>Hashing isn't a form of encryption, but it does use cryptography. Hash functions deterministically map arbitrary pieces of data into fixed-length values. It's easy to compute the hash from the input, but very difficult (i.e. infeasible) to determine the original input from the hash. Additionally, the hash will completely change when even a single bit of the input changes. Hash functions are used for integrity verification, but don't provide an authenticity guarantee.</p> <p>Message Authentication Codes (MACs) combine other cryptographic mechanisms (such as symmetric encryption or hashes) with secret keys to provide both integrity and authenticity protection. However, in order to verify a MAC, multiple entities have to share the same secret key and any of those entities can generate a valid MAC. HMACs, the most commonly used type of MAC, rely on hashing as the underlying cryptographic primitive. The full name of an HMAC algorithm usually includes the underlying hash function's type (for example, HMAC-SHA256 uses the SHA-256 hash function).</p> <p>Signatures combine asymmetric cryptography (that is, using a public/private key pair) with hashing to provide integrity and authenticity by encrypting the hash of the message with the private key. However, unlike MACs, signatures also provide non-repudiation property as the private key should remain unique to the data signer.</p> <p>Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) derive secret keys from a secret value (such as a password) and are used to turn keys into other formats or to increase their length. KDFs are similar to hashing functions but have other uses as well (for example, they are used as components of multi-party key-agreement protocols). While both hashing functions and KDFs must be difficult to reverse, KDFs have the added requirement that the keys they produce must have a level of randomness.</p>","tags":["MASVS-CRYPTO","all"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x04g-Testing-Cryptography/#identifying-insecure-andor-deprecated-cryptographic-algorithms","title":"Identifying Insecure and/or Deprecated Cryptographic Algorithms","text":"<p>When assessing a mobile app, you should make sure that it does not use cryptographic algorithms and protocols that have significant known weaknesses or are otherwise insufficient for modern security requirements.

This class of bug results from a programming error that causes the program to access an unintended memory location. Under the right conditions, attackers can capitalize on this behavior to hijack the execution flow of the vulnerable program and execute arbitrary code. This kind of vulnerability occurs in a number of ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Buffer overflows: This describes a programming error where an app writes beyond an allocated memory range for a particular operation. An attacker can use this flaw to overwrite important control data located in adjacent memory, such as function pointers. Buffer overflows were formerly the most common type of memory corruption flaw, but have become less prevalent over the years due to a number of factors. Notably, awareness among developers of the risks in using unsafe C library functions is now a common best practice plus, catching buffer overflow bugs is relatively simple. However, it is still worth testing for such defects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Out-of-bounds-access: Buggy pointer arithmetic may cause a pointer or index to reference a position beyond the bounds of the intended memory structure (e.g. buffer or list). When an app attempts to write to an out-of-bounds address, a crash or unintended behavior occurs. If the attacker can control the target offset and manipulate the content written to some extent, code execution exploit is likely possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dangling pointers: These occur when an object with an incoming reference to a memory location is deleted or deallocated, but the object pointer is not reset. If the program later uses the dangling pointer to call a virtual function of the already deallocated object, it is possible to hijack execution by overwriting the original vtable pointer. Alternatively, it is possible to read or write object variables or other memory structures referenced by a dangling pointer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use-after-free: This refers to a special case of dangling pointers referencing released (deallocated) memory. After a memory address is cleared, all pointers referencing the location become invalid, causing the memory manager to return the address to a pool of available memory. When this memory location is eventually re-allocated, accessing the original pointer will read or write the data contained in the newly allocated memory. This usually leads to data corruption and undefined behavior, but crafty attackers can set up the appropriate memory locations to leverage control of the instruction pointer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integer overflows: When the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value for the integer type defined by the programmer, this results in the value \"wrapping around\" the maximum integer value, inevitably resulting in a small value being stored. Conversely, when the result of an arithmetic operation is smaller than the minimum value of the integer type, an integer underflow occurs where the result is larger than expected. Whether a particular integer overflow/underflow bug is exploitable depends on how the integer is used. For example, if the integer type were to represent the length of a buffer, this could create a buffer overflow vulnerability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Format string vulnerabilities: When unchecked user input is passed to the format string parameter of the <code>printf</code> family of C functions, attackers may inject format tokens such as \u2018%c\u2019 and \u2018%n\u2019 to access memory. Format string bugs are convenient to exploit due to their flexibility. Should a program output the result of the string formatting operation, the attacker can read and write to memory arbitrarily, thus bypassing protection features such as ASLR.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The primary goal in exploiting memory corruption is usually to redirect program flow into a location where the attacker has placed assembled machine instructions referred to as shellcode. On iOS, the data execution prevention feature (as the name implies) prevents execution from memory defined as data segments. To bypass this protection, attackers leverage return-oriented programming (ROP). This process involves chaining together small, pre-existing code chunks (\"gadgets\") in the text segment where these gadgets may execute a function useful to the attacker or, call <code>mprotect</code> to change memory protection settings for the location where the attacker stored the shellcode.</p> <p>Android apps are, for the most part, implemented in Java which is inherently safe from memory corruption issues by design. However, native apps utilizing JNI libraries are susceptible to this kind of bug. In rare cases, Android apps that use XML/JSON parsers to unwrap Java objects are also subject to memory corruption bugs. An example of such vulnerability was found in the PayPal app.</p> <p>Similarly, iOS apps can wrap C/C++ calls in Obj-C or Swift, making them susceptible to these kind of attacks.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>The following code snippet shows a simple example for a condition resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability.</p> <pre><code> void copyData(char *userId) {  \n    char  smallBuffer[10]; // size of 10  \n    strcpy(smallBuffer, userId);\n }  \n</code></pre> <p>To identify potential buffer overflows, look for uses of unsafe string functions (<code>strcpy</code>, <code>strcat</code>, other functions beginning with the \"str\" prefix, etc.) and potentially vulnerable programming constructs, such as copying user input into a limited-size buffer. The following should be considered red flags for unsafe string functions:</p> <ul> <li><code>strcat</code></li> <li><code>strcpy</code></li> <li><code>strncat</code></li> <li><code>strlcat</code></li> <li><code>strncpy</code></li> <li><code>strlcpy</code></li> <li><code>sprintf</code></li> <li><code>snprintf</code></li> <li><code>gets</code></li> </ul> <p>Also, look for instances of copy operations implemented as \"for\" or \"while\" loops and verify length checks are performed correctly.</p> <p>Verify that the following best practices have been followed:</p> <ul> <li>When using integer variables for array indexing, buffer length calculations, or any other security-critical operation, verify that unsigned integer types are used and perform precondition tests are performed to prevent the possibility of integer wrapping.</li> <li>The app does not use unsafe string functions such as <code>strcpy</code>, most other functions beginning with the \"str\" prefix, <code>sprint</code>, <code>vsprintf</code>, <code>gets</code>, etc.;</li> <li>If the app contains C++ code, ANSI C++ string classes are used;</li> <li>In case of <code>memcpy</code>, make sure you check that the target buffer is at least of equal size as the source and that both buffers are not overlapping.</li> <li>iOS apps written in Objective-C use NSString class.

Today the platform is the foundation for a wide variety of modern technology, such as mobile phones, tablets, wearable tech, TVs, and other smart devices. Typical Android builds ship with a range of pre-installed (\"stock\") apps and support installation of third-party apps through the Google Play store and other marketplaces.</p> <p>Android's software stack is composed of several different layers. Each layer defines interfaces and offers specific services.</p> <p></p> <p>Kernel: At the lowest level, Android is based on a variation of the Linux Kernel containing some significant additions, including Low Memory Killer, wake locks, the Binder IPC driver, etc. For the purpose of the MASTG, we'll focus on the user-mode part of the OS, where Android significantly differs from a typical Linux distribution. The two most important components for us are the managed runtime used by applications (ART/Dalvik) and Bionic, Android\u2019s version of glibc, the GNU C library.</p> <p>HAL: On top of the kernel, the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) defines a standard interface for interacting with built-in hardware components. Several HAL implementations are packaged into shared library modules that the Android system calls when required. This is the basis for allowing applications to interact with the device's hardware. For example, it allows a stock phone application to use a device's microphone and speaker.</p> <p>Runtime Environment: Android apps are written in Java and Kotlin and then compiled to Dalvik bytecode which can be then executed using a runtime that interprets the bytecode instructions and executes them on the target device. For Android, this is the Android Runtime (ART). This is similar to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) for Java applications, or the Mono Runtime for .NET applications.</p> <p>Dalvik bytecode is an optimized version of Java bytecode. It is created by first compiling the Java or Kotlin code to Java bytecode, using the javac and kotlinc compilers respectively, producing .class files. Finally, the Java bytecode is converted to Dalvik bytecode using the d8 tool. Dalvik bytecode is packed within APK and AAB files in the form of .dex files and is used by a managed runtime on Android to execute it on the device.</p> <p></p> <p>Before Android 5.0 (API level 21), Android executed bytecode on the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), where it was translated into machine code at execution time, a process known as just-in-time (JIT) compilation. This enables the runtime to benefit from the speed of compiled code while maintaining the flexibility of code interpretation.</p> <p>Since Android 5.0 (API level 21), Android executes bytecode on the Android Runtime (ART) which is the successor of the DVM. ART provides improved performance as well as context information in app native crash reports, by including both Java and native stack information. It uses the same Dalvik bytecode input to maintain backward compatibility. However, ART executes the Dalvik bytecode differently, using a hybrid combination of ahead-of-time (AOT), just-in-time (JIT) and profile-guided compilation.</p> <ul> <li>AOT pre-compiles Dalvik bytecode into native code, and the generated code will be saved on disk with the .oat extension (ELF binary). The dex2oat tool can be used to perform the compilation and can be found at /system/bin/dex2oat on Android devices. AOT compilation is executed during the installation of the app. This makes the application start faster, as no compilation is needed anymore. However, this also means that the install time increases as compared to JIT compilation. Additionally, since applications are always optimized against the current version of the OS, this means that software updates will recompile all previously compiled applications, resulting in a significant increase in the system update time. Finally, AOT compilation will compile the entire application, even if certain parts are never used by the user.</li> <li>JIT happens at runtime.</li> <li>Profile-guided compilation is a hybrid approach that was introduced in Android 7 (API level 24) to combat the downsides of AOT. At first, the application will use JIT compilation, and Android keeps track of all the parts of the application that are frequently used. This information is stored in an application profile and when the device is idle, a compilation (dex2oat) daemon runs which AOT compiles the identified frequent code paths from the profile.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Source: https://lief-project.github.io/doc/latest/tutorials/10_android_formats.html</p> <p>Sandboxing: Android apps don't have direct access to hardware resources, and each app runs in its own virtual machine or sandbox. This enables the OS to have precise control over resources and memory access on the device. For instance, a crashing app doesn't affect other apps running on the same device. Android controls the maximum number of system resources allocated to apps, preventing any one app from monopolizing too many resources. At the same time, this sandbox design can be considered as one of the many principles in Android's global defense-in-depth strategy. A malicious third-party application, with low privileges, shouldn't be able to escape its own runtime and read the memory of a victim application on the same device. In the following section we take a closer look at the different defense layers in the Android operating system. Learn more in the section \"Software Isolation\".</p> <p>You can find more detailed information in the Google Source article \"Android Runtime (ART)\", the book \"Android Internals\" by Jonathan Levin and the blog post \"Android 101\" by @_qaz_qaz.</p>","tags":[]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05a-Platform-Overview/#android-security-defense-in-depth-approach","title":"Android Security: Defense-in-Depth Approach","text":"<p>The Android architecture implements different security layers that, together, enable a defense-in-depth approach.

Linux directory permissions are set such that the directory can be read from and written to only with the app's unique UID.</p> <p></p> <p>We can confirm this by looking at the file system permissions in the <code>/data/data</code> folder. For example, we can see that Google Chrome and Calendar are assigned one directory each and run under different user accounts:</p> <pre><code>drwx------  4 u0_a97              u0_a97              4096 2017-01-18 14:27 com.android.calendar\ndrwx------  6 u0_a120             u0_a120             4096 2017-01-19 12:54 com.android.chrome\n</code></pre> <p>Developers who want their apps to share a common sandbox can sidestep sandboxing.

Although intents facilitate inter-component communication in several ways, there are three fundamental use cases:</p> <ul> <li>Starting an activity<ul> <li>An activity represents a single screen in an app. You can start a new instance of an activity by passing an intent to <code>startActivity</code>. The intent describes the activity and carries necessary data.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Starting a service<ul> <li>A Service is a component that performs operations in the background, without a user interface. With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can start a service with JobScheduler.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Delivering a broadcast<ul> <li>A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. The system delivers broadcasts for system events, including system boot and charging initialization. You can deliver a broadcast to other apps by passing an intent to <code>sendBroadcast</code> or <code>sendOrderedBroadcast</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>There are two types of intents. Explicit intents name the component that will be started (the fully qualified class name). For instance:</p> <p>Example in Java:</p> <pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(this, myActivity.myClass);\n</code></pre> <p>Example in Kotlin:</p> <pre><code>var intent = Intent(this, myActivity.myClass)\n</code></pre> <p>Implicit intents are sent to the OS to perform a given action on a given set of data (The URL of the OWASP website in our example below). It is up to the system to decide which app or class will perform the corresponding service. For instance:</p> <p>Example in Java:</p> <pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.MY_ACTION, Uri.parse(\"https://www.owasp.org\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Example in Kotlin:</p> <pre><code>var intent = Intent(Intent.MY_ACTION, Uri.parse(\"https://www.owasp.org\"))\n</code></pre> <p>An intent filter is an expression in Android Manifest files that specifies the type of intents the component would like to receive. For instance, by declaring an intent filter for an activity, you make it possible for other apps to directly start your activity with a certain kind of intent. Likewise, your activity can only be started with an explicit intent if you don't declare any intent filters for it.</p> <p>Android uses intents to broadcast messages to apps (such as an incoming call or SMS) important power supply information (low battery, for example), and network changes (loss of connection, for instance). Extra data may be added to intents (through <code>putExtra</code>/<code>getExtras</code>).</p> <p>Here is a short list of intents sent by the operating system. All constants are defined in the Intent class, and the whole list is in the official Android documentation:</p> <ul> <li>ACTION_CAMERA_BUTTON</li> <li>ACTION_MEDIA_EJECT</li> <li>ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL</li> <li>ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED</li> </ul> <p>To improve security and privacy, a Local Broadcast Manager is used to send and receive intents within an app without having them sent to the rest of the operating system.

One way is to declare it in the Android Manifest file. The manifest should specify an association between the Broadcast Receiver and an intent filter to indicate the actions the receiver is meant to listen for.</p> <p>An example Broadcast Receiver declaration with an intent filter in a manifest:</p> <pre><code>&lt;receiver android:name=\".MyReceiver\" &gt;\n    &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n        &lt;action android:name=\"com.owasp.myapplication.MY_ACTION\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n&lt;/receiver&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Please note that in this example, the Broadcast Receiver does not include the <code>android:exported</code> attribute. As at least one filter was defined, the default value will be set to \"true\". In absence of any filters, it will be set to \"false\".</p> <p>The other way is to create the receiver dynamically in code.

Certificates are bundles of information; in terms of security, keys are the most important part of that bundle. Public certificates contain users' public keys, and private certificates contain users' private keys. Public and private certificates are linked. Certificates are unique and can't be re-generated. Note that if a certificate is lost, it cannot be recovered, so updating any apps signed with that certificate becomes impossible. App creators can either reuse an existing private/public key pair that is in an available KeyStore or generate a new pair. In the Android SDK, a new key pair is generated with the <code>keytool</code> command. The following command creates a RSA key pair with a key length of 2048 bits and an expiry time of 7300 days = 20 years. The generated key pair is stored in the file 'myKeyStore.jks', which is in the current directory:</p> <pre><code>keytool -genkey -alias myDomain -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 7300 -keystore myKeyStore.jks -storepass myStrongPassword\n</code></pre> <p>Safely storing your secret key and making sure it remains secret during its entire life cycle is of paramount importance. Anyone who gains access to the key will be able to publish updates to your apps with content that you don't control (thereby adding insecure features or accessing shared content with signature-based permissions). The trust that a user places in an app and its developers is based totally on such certificates; certificate protection and secure management are therefore vital for reputation and customer retention, and secret keys must never be shared with other individuals. Keys are stored in a binary file that can be protected with a password; such files are referred to as KeyStores. KeyStore passwords should be strong and known only to the key creator. For this reason, keys are usually stored on a dedicated build machine that developers have limited access to. An Android certificate must have a validity period that's longer than that of the associated app (including updated versions of the app). For example, Google Play will require certificates to remain valid until Oct 22nd, 2033 at least.</p>","tags":[]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05a-Platform-Overview/#signing-an-application","title":"Signing an Application","text":"<p>The goal of the signing process is to associate the app file (.apk) with the developer's public key.

A full overview of the pros and cons of each approach is listed in the table below.</p> Property Physical Emulator/Simulator Ability to restore Softbricks are always possible, but new firmware can typically still be flashed. Hardbricks are very rare. Emulators can crash or become corrupt, but a new one can be created or a snapshot can be restored. Reset Can be restored to factory settings or reflashed. Emulators can be deleted and recreated. Snapshots Not possible. Supported, great for malware analysis. Speed Much faster than emulators. Typically slow, but improvements are being made. Cost Typically start at $200 for a usable device. You may require different devices, such as one with or without a biometric sensor. Both free and commercial solutions exist. Ease of rooting Highly dependent on the device. Typically rooted by default. Ease of emulator detection It's not an emulator, so emulator checks are not applicable. Many artefacts will exist, making it easy to detect that the app is running in an emulator. Ease of root detection Easier to hide root, as many root detection algorithms check for emulator properties. With Magisk Systemless root it's nearly impossible to detect. Emulators will almost always trigger root detection algorithms due to the fact that they are built for testing with many artefacts that can be found. Hardware interaction Easy interaction through Bluetooth, NFC, 4G, Wi-Fi, biometrics, camera, GPS, gyroscope, ... Usually fairly limited, with emulated hardware input (e.g. random GPS coordinates) API level support Depends on the device and the community. Active communities will keep distributing updated versions (e.g. LineageOS), while less popular devices may only receive a few updates. Switching between versions requires flashing the device, a tedious process. Always supports the latest versions, including beta releases. Emulators containing specific API levels can easily be downloaded and launched. Native library support Native libraries are usually built for ARM devices, so they will work on a physical device. Some emulators run on x86 CPUs, so they may not be able to run packaged native libraries. Malware danger Malware samples can infect a device, but if you can clear out the device storage and flash a clean firmware, thereby restoring it to factory settings, this should not be a problem. Be aware that there are malware samples that try to exploit the USB bridge. Malware samples can infect an emulator, but the emulator can simply be removed and recreated.

From Android 8.0 (API level 26), the key attestation was made mandatory for all new (Android 7.0 or higher) devices that need to have device certification for Google apps. Such devices use attestation keys signed by the Google hardware Attestation Root certificate and the same can be verified through the key attestation process.</p> <p>During key attestation, we can specify the alias of a key pair and in return, get a certificate chain, which we can use to verify the properties of that key pair. If the root certificate of the chain is the Google Hardware Attestation Root certificate, and the checks related to key pair storage in hardware are made, it gives an assurance that the device supports hardware-level key attestation, and that the key is in the hardware-backed keystore that Google believes to be secure. Alternatively, if the attestation chain has any other root certificate, then Google does not make any claims about the security of the hardware.</p> <p>Although the key attestation process can be implemented within the application directly, it is recommended that it should be implemented at the server-side for security reasons. The following are the high-level guidelines for the secure implementation of Key Attestation:</p> <ul> <li>The server should initiate the key attestation process by creating a random number securely using CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator) and the same should be sent to the user as a challenge.</li> <li>The client should call the <code>setAttestationChallenge</code> API with the challenge received from the server and should then retrieve the attestation certificate chain using the <code>KeyStore.getCertificateChain</code> method.</li> <li>The attestation response should be sent to the server for the verification and following checks should be performed for the verification of the key attestation response:<ul> <li>Verify the certificate chain, up to the root and perform certificate sanity checks such as validity, integrity and trustworthiness. Check the Certificate Revocation Status List maintained by Google, if none of the certificates in the chain was revoked.</li> <li>Check if the root certificate is signed with the Google attestation root key which makes the attestation process trustworthy.</li> <li>Extract the attestation certificate extension data, which appears within the first element of the certificate chain, and perform the following checks:<ul> <li>Verify that the attestation challenge is having the same value which was generated at the server while initiating the attestation process.</li> <li>Verify the signature in the key attestation response.</li> <li>Verify the security level of the Keymaster, to determine if the device has secure key storage mechanism. Keymaster is a piece of software that runs in the security context and provides all the secure keystore operations. The security level will be one of <code>Software</code>, <code>TrustedEnvironment</code> or <code>StrongBox</code>. The client supports hardware-level key attestation if the security level is <code>TrustedEnvironment</code> or <code>StrongBox</code> and the attestation certificate chain contains a root certificate signed with the Google attestation root key.</li> <li>Verify the client's status to ensure a full chain of trust - verified boot key, locked bootloader and verified boot state.</li> <li>Additionally, you can verify the key pair's attributes such as purpose, access time, authentication requirement, etc.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Note, if for any reason that process fails, it means that the key is not in security hardware.

It is of no surprise then that at times sensitive operations will be performed within process memory. For this reason, it is important that once the relevant sensitive data has been processed, it should be disposed from process memory as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The investigation of an application's memory can be done from memory dumps, and from analyzing the memory in real time via a debugger.</p> <p>For an overview of possible sources of data exposure, check the documentation and identify application components before you examine the source code. For example, sensitive data from a backend may be in the HTTP client, the XML parser, etc. You want all these copies to be removed from memory as soon as possible.</p> <p>In addition, understanding the application's architecture and the architecture's role in the system will help you identify sensitive information that doesn't have to be exposed in memory at all. For example, assume your app receives data from one server and transfers it to another without any processing. That data can be handled in an encrypted format, which prevents exposure in memory.</p> <p>However, if you need to expose sensitive data in memory, you should make sure that your app is designed to expose as few data copies as possible as briefly as possible. In other words, you want the handling of sensitive data to be centralized (i.e., with as few components as possible) and based on primitive, mutable data structures.</p> <p>The latter requirement gives developers direct memory access. Make sure that they use this access to overwrite the sensitive data with dummy data (typically zeroes). Examples of preferable data types include <code>byte []</code> and <code>char []</code>, but not <code>String</code> or <code>BigInteger</code>. Whenever you try to modify an immutable object like <code>String</code>, you create and change a copy of the object.</p> <p>Using non-primitive mutable types like <code>StringBuffer</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> may be acceptable, but it's indicative and requires care. Types like <code>StringBuffer</code> are used to modify content (which is what you want to do). To access such a type's value, however, you would use the <code>toString</code> method, which would create an immutable copy of the data. There are several ways to use these data types without creating an immutable copy, but they require more effort than using a primitive array. Safe memory management is one benefit of using types like <code>StringBuffer</code> , but this can be a two-edged sword. If you try to modify the content of one of these types and the copy exceeds the buffer capacity, the buffer size will automatically increase. The buffer content may be copied to a different location, leaving the old content without a reference use to overwrite it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, few libraries and frameworks are designed to allow sensitive data to be overwritten. For example, destroying a key, as shown below, doesn't remove the key from memory:</p> <p>Example in Java:</p> <pre><code>SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(\"key\".getBytes(), \"AES\");\nsecretKey.destroy();\n</code></pre> <p>Example in Kotlin:</p> <pre><code>val secretKey: SecretKey = SecretKeySpec(\"key\".toByteArray(), \"AES\")\nsecretKey.destroy()\n</code></pre> <p>Overwriting the backing byte-array from <code>secretKey.getEncoded</code> doesn't remove the key either; the SecretKeySpec-based key returns a copy of the backing byte-array. See the sections below for the proper way to remove a <code>SecretKey</code> from memory.</p> <p>The RSA key pair is based on the <code>BigInteger</code> type and therefore resides in memory after its first use outside the <code>AndroidKeyStore</code>. Some ciphers (such as the AES <code>Cipher</code> in <code>BouncyCastle</code>) do not properly clean up their byte-arrays.</p> <p>User-provided data (credentials, social security numbers, credit card information, etc.) is another type of data that may be exposed in memory. Regardless of whether you flag it as a password field, <code>EditText</code> delivers content to the app via the <code>Editable</code> interface. If your app doesn't provide <code>Editable.Factory</code>, user-provided data will probably be exposed in memory for longer than necessary. The default <code>Editable</code> implementation, the <code>SpannableStringBuilder</code>, causes the same issues as Java's <code>StringBuilder</code> and <code>StringBuffer</code> cause (discussed above).</p>","tags":["MASVS-STORAGE","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05d-Testing-Data-Storage/#third-party-services-embedded-in-the-app","title":"Third-party Services Embedded in the App","text":"<p>The features provided by third-party services can involve tracking services to monitor the user's behavior while using the app, selling banner advertisements, or improving the user experience.</p> <p>The downside is that developers don't usually know the details of the code executed via third-party libraries.

This cryptographic protocol is designed to generate cryptographic keys, which can be used for cryptography purpose. Input parameters for the algorithm are adjusted according to weak key generation function section. The code listing below illustrates how to generate a strong encryption key based on a password.</p> <pre><code>public static SecretKey generateStrongAESKey(char[] password, int keyLength)\n{\n    //Initialize objects and variables for later use\n    int iterationCount = 10000;\n    int saltLength     = keyLength / 8;\n    SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\n    //Generate the salt\n    byte[] salt = new byte[saltLength];\n    random.nextBytes(salt);\n    KeySpec keySpec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt, iterationCount, keyLength);\n    SecretKeyFactory keyFactory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1\");\n    byte[] keyBytes = keyFactory.generateSecret(keySpec).getEncoded();\n    return new SecretKeySpec(keyBytes, \"AES\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The above method requires a character array containing the password and the needed key length in bits, for instance a 128 or 256-bit AES key. We define an iteration count of 10,000 rounds which will be used by the PBKDF2 algorithm. Increasing the number of iterations significantly increases the workload for a brute-force attack on the password, however it can affect performance as more computational power is required for key derivation. We define the salt size equal to the key length divided by 8 in order to convert from bits to bytes and we use the <code>SecureRandom</code> class to randomly generate a salt.

The caller registers callback methods to handle possible outcomes of the authentication process (i.e. success, failure, or error). Note that this method doesn't constitute strong proof that fingerprint authentication has actually been performed - for example, the authentication step could be patched out by an attacker, or the \"success\" callback could be overloaded using dynamic instrumentation.</p> <p>You can achieve better security by using the fingerprint API in conjunction with the Android <code>KeyGenerator</code> class. With this approach, a symmetric key is stored in the Android KeyStore and unlocked with the user's fingerprint. For example, to enable user access to a remote service, an AES key is created which encrypts the authentication token. By calling <code>setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)</code> when creating the key, it is ensured that the user must re-authenticate to retrieve it. The encrypted authentication token can then be saved directly on the device (e.g. via Shared Preferences). This design is a relatively safe way to ensure the user actually entered an authorized fingerprint.</p> <p>An even more secure option is using asymmetric cryptography.

The Android developer documentation offers valuable insights and best practices to help apps achieve the same level of functionality without requiring direct access to sensitive resources:</p> <ul> <li>Minimize your permission requests</li> <li>App permissions best practices</li> <li>Permissions and APIs that Access Sensitive Information</li> </ul> <p>Android permissions can be classified into distinct categories depending on the extent of restricted data access and permitted actions that they grant to an app. This classification includes the so-called \"Protection Level\" as shown on the permissions API reference page and AndroidManifest.xml Source Definitions.</p> <ul> <li>Install-time permissions: grant limited access to restricted data or let the app perform restricted actions that minimally affect the system or other apps. They are granted automatically at installation time (Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher).<ul> <li>Protection Level: <code>normal</code>. Grants apps access to isolated application-level features with minimal risk to other apps, the user, and the system.

Old synonym for <code>signature|privileged</code>. Deprecated in API level 23.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Runtime permissions: require prompting the user at runtime for explicit approval.<ul> <li>Protection Level: <code>dangerous</code>.

The paper gives us an example of that:</p> <p>Prior to Android 10, the <code>READ_PHONE_STATE</code> permission would be classified as HIGH, due to the permanent device identifiers (e.g. (IMEI/MEID, IMSI, SIM, and build serial) that it guards. However, starting from Android 10, a bulk of the sensitive information that can be used for tracking has been moved, refactored or rescoped into a new permission called <code>READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE</code>, putting the new permission in the HIGH category, but resulting in the <code>READ_PHONE_STATE</code> permission moving to LOW.</p>","tags":["MASVS-PLATFORM","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05h-Testing-Platform-Interaction/#permission-changes-per-api-level","title":"Permission Changes per API Level","text":"<p>Android 8.0 (API level 26) Changes:</p> <p>The following changes affect all apps running on Android 8.0 (API level 26), even to those apps targeting lower API levels.</p> <ul> <li>Contacts provider usage stats change: when an app requests the <code>READ_CONTACTS</code> permission, queries for contact's usage data will return approximations rather than exact values (the auto-complete API is not affected by this change).</li> </ul> <p>Apps targeting Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher are affected by the following:</p> <ul> <li>Account access and discoverability improvements: Apps can no longer get access to user accounts only by having the <code>GET_ACCOUNTS</code> permission granted, unless the authenticator owns the accounts or the user grants that access.</li> <li>New telephony permissions: the following permissions (classified as dangerous) are now part of the <code>PHONE</code> permissions group:<ul> <li>The <code>ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS</code> permission allows to answer incoming phone calls programmatically (via <code>acceptRingingCall</code>).</li> <li>The <code>READ_PHONE_NUMBERS</code> permission grants read access to the phone numbers stored in the device.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Restrictions when granting dangerous permissions: Dangerous permissions are classified into permission groups (e.g. the <code>STORAGE</code> group contains <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> and <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>). Before Android 8.0 (API level 26), it was sufficient to request one permission of the group in order to get all permissions of that group also granted at the same time. This has changed starting at Android 8.0 (API level 26): whenever an app requests a permission at runtime, the system will grant exclusively that specific permission. However, note that all subsequent requests for permissions in that permission group will be automatically granted without showing the permissions dialog to the user. See this example from the Android developer documentation:</p> <p>Suppose an app lists both READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE in its manifest. The app requests READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and the user grants it. If the app targets API level 25 or lower, the system also grants WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE at the same time, because it belongs to the same STORAGE permission group and is also registered in the manifest. If the app targets Android 8.0 (API level 26), the system grants only READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE at that time; however, if the app later requests WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, the system immediately grants that privilege without prompting the user.</p> <p>You can see the list of permission groups in the Android developer documentation. To make this a bit more confusing, Google also warns that particular permissions might be moved from one group to another in future versions of the Android SDK and therefore, the logic of the app shouldn't rely on the structure of these permission groups.

Not holding the required permission results in a <code>SecurityException</code> being thrown from the call.</p> <p>Broadcast Permission Enforcement:</p> <p>Permissions applied via <code>android:permission</code> attribute within the <code>&lt;receiver&gt;</code> tag restrict access to send broadcasts to the associated <code>BroadcastReceiver</code>. The held permissions are checked after <code>Context.sendBroadcast</code> returns, while trying to deliver the sent broadcast to the given receiver. Not holding the required permissions doesn't throw an exception, the result is an unsent broadcast.</p> <p>A permission can be supplied to <code>Context.registerReceiver</code> to control who can broadcast to a programmatically registered receiver. Going the other way, a permission can be supplied when calling <code>Context.sendBroadcast</code> to restrict which broadcast receivers are allowed to receive the broadcast.</p> <p>Note that both a receiver and a broadcaster can require a permission. When this happens, both permission checks must pass for the intent to be delivered to the associated target. For more information, please reference the section \"Restricting broadcasts with permissions\" in the Android Developers Documentation.</p> <p>Content Provider Permission Enforcement:</p> <p>Permissions applied via <code>android:permission</code> attribute within the <code>&lt;provider&gt;</code> tag restrict access to data in a ContentProvider. Content providers have an important additional security facility called URI permissions which is described next. Unlike the other components, ContentProviders have two separate permission attributes that can be set, <code>android:readPermission</code> restricts who can read from the provider, and <code>android:writePermission</code> restricts who can write to it. If a ContentProvider is protected with both read and write permissions, holding only the write permission does not also grant read permissions.</p> <p>Permissions are checked when you first retrieve a provider and as operations are performed using the ContentProvider. Using <code>ContentResolver.query</code> requires holding the read permission; using <code>ContentResolver.insert</code>, <code>ContentResolver.update</code>, <code>ContentResolver.delete</code> requires the write permission. A <code>SecurityException</code> will be thrown from the call if proper permissions are not held in all these cases.</p> <p>Content Provider URI Permissions:</p> <p>The standard permission system is not sufficient when being used with content providers. For example a content provider may want to limit permissions to READ permissions in order to protect itself, while using custom URIs to retrieve information. An application should only have the permission for that specific URI.</p> <p>The solution is per-URI permissions. When starting or returning a result from an activity, the method can set <code>Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION</code> and/or <code>Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION</code>. This grants permission to the activity for the specific URI regardless if it has permissions to access to data from the content provider.</p> <p>This allows a common capability-style model where user interaction drives ad-hoc granting of fine-grained permission. This can be a key facility for reducing the permissions needed by apps to only those directly related to their behavior. Without this model in place malicious users may access other member's email attachments or harvest contact lists for future use via unprotected URIs. In the manifest the <code>android:grantUriPermissions</code> attribute or the node help restrict the URIs.</p> <p>Here you can find more information about APIs related to URI Permissions:</p> <ul> <li>grantUriPermission</li> <li>revokeUriPermission</li> <li>checkUriPermission</li> </ul>","tags":["MASVS-PLATFORM","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05h-Testing-Platform-Interaction/#custom-permissions","title":"Custom Permissions","text":"<p>Android allows apps to expose their services/components to other apps.

The receiving application of the <code>PendingIntent</code>, will unwrap and retrieve this base intent and invoke the activity A by calling the <code>PendingIntent.send</code> function.</p> <p>A typical implementation for using <code>PendingIntent</code> is below:</p> <pre><code>Intent intent = new Intent(applicationContext, SomeActivity.class);     // base intent\n\n// create a pending intent\nPendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(applicationContext, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE);\n\n// send the pending intent to another app\nIntent anotherIntent = new Intent();\nanotherIntent.setClassName(\"other.app\", \"other.app.MainActivity\");\nanotherIntent.putExtra(\"pendingIntent\", pendingIntent);\nstartActivity(anotherIntent);\n</code></pre> <p>What makes a <code>PendingIntent</code> secure is that, unlike a normal <code>Intent</code>, it grants permission to a foreign application to use the <code>Intent</code> (the base intent) it contains, as if it were being executed by your application's own process. This allows an application to freely use them to create callbacks without the need to create exported activities.</p> <p>If not implemented correctly, a malicious application can hijack a <code>PendingIntent</code>. For example, in the notification example above, a malicious application with <code>android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE</code> can bind to the notification listener service and retrieve the pending intent.</p> <p>There are certain security pitfalls when implementing <code>PendingIntent</code>s, which are listed below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mutable fields: A <code>PendingIntent</code> can have mutable and empty fields that can be filled by a malicious application. This can lead to a malicious application gaining access to non-exported application components. Using the <code>PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE</code> flag makes the <code>PendingIntent</code> immutable and prevents any changes to the fields. Prior to Android 12 (API level 31), the <code>PendingIntent</code> was mutable by default, while since Android 12 (API level 31) it is changed to immutable by default to prevent accidental vulnerabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use of implicit intent: A malicious application can receive a <code>PendingIntent</code> and then update the base intent to target the component and package within the malicious application. As a mitigation, ensure that you explicitly specify the exact package, action and component that will receive the base intent.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The most common case of <code>PendingIntent</code> attack is when a malicious application is able to intercept it.</p> <p>For further details, check the Android documentation on using a pending intent.</p>","tags":["MASVS-PLATFORM","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05h-Testing-Platform-Interaction/#implicit-intents","title":"Implicit Intents","text":"<p>An Intent is a messaging object that you can use to request an action from another application component.

Typically, you'll use an explicit intent to start a component in your own app, because you know the class name of the activity or service you want to start. For example, you might want to start a new activity in your app in response to a user action, or start a service to download a file in the background.</li> </ul> <pre><code>// Note the specification of a concrete component (DownloadActivity) that is started by the intent.\nIntent downloadIntent = new Intent(this, DownloadActivity.class);\ndownloadIntent.setAction(\"android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT\")\nstartActivityForResult(downloadIntent);\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Implicit intents do not name a specific component, but instead declare a general action to be performed that another app's component can handle. For example, if you want to show the user a location on a map, you can use an implicit intent to ask another capable app to show a specific location on a map. Another example is when the user clicks on an email address within an app, where the calling app does not want to specify a specific email app and leaves that choice up to the user.</li> </ul> <pre><code>// Developers can also start an activity by just setting an action that is matched by the intended app.\nIntent downloadIntent = new Intent();\ndownloadIntent.setAction(\"android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT\")\nstartActivityForResult(downloadIntent);\n</code></pre> <p>The use of implicit intents can lead to multiple security risks, e.g. if the calling app processes the return value of the implicit intent without proper verification or if the intent contains sensitive data, it can be accidentally leaked to unauthorized third-parties.</p> <p>You can refer to this blog post, this article and CWE-927 for more information about the mentioned problem, concrete attack scenarios and recommendations.</p>","tags":["MASVS-PLATFORM","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05h-Testing-Platform-Interaction/#object-persistence","title":"Object Persistence","text":"<p>There are several ways to persist an object on Android:</p>","tags":["MASVS-PLATFORM","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05h-Testing-Platform-Interaction/#object-serialization","title":"Object Serialization","text":"<p>An object and its data can be represented as a sequence of bytes.

The result can be <code>LICENSED</code>, indicating that the user purchased or installed the app on the Google Play Store; <code>UNLICENSED</code>, meaning that the user does not own the app or did not acquire it through the Google Play Store; or <code>UNEVALUATED</code>, which means that the licensing details could not be evaluated because a necessary requirement is missing, that is, the device may not be trustworthy enough or the installed app version is not recognized by the Google Play Store.</p> </li> <li> <p>Device Integrity: This section presents information that verifies the authenticity of the Android environment in which the app is running.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY</code>: The app is on an Android device with Google Play Services, passing system integrity checks and compatibility requirements.</p> </li> <li><code>MEETS_BASIC_INTEGRITY</code>: The app is on a device that may not be approved to run Google Play Services but passes basic integrity checks, possibly due to an unrecognized Android version, unlocked bootloader, or lack of manufacturer certification.</li> <li><code>MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY</code>: The app is on a device with Google Play Services, ensuring robust system integrity with features like hardware-protected boot.</li> <li><code>MEETS_VIRTUAL_INTEGRITY</code>: The app runs in an emulator with Google Play Services, passing system integrity checks and meeting Android compatibility requirements.</li> </ol> <p>API Errors:</p> <p>The API can return local errors such as <code>APP_NOT_INSTALLED</code> and <code>APP_UID_MISMATCH</code>, which can indicate a fraud attempt or attack. In addition, outdated Google Play Services or Play Store can also cause errors, and it is important to check these situations to ensure proper integrity verification functionality and to ensure the environment is not intentionally set up for an attack. You can find more details on the official page.</p> <p>Best practices:</p> <ol> <li>Use Play Integrity as part of a broader security strategy. Complement it with additional security measures such as input data validation, user authentication, and anti-fraud protection.</li> <li> <p>Minimize queries to the Play Protect API to reduce device resource impact. For example, employ the API only for essential device integrity verifications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Include a <code>NONCE</code> with integrity verification requests. This random value, generated by the app or server, helps the verification server confirm that responses match the original requests without third-party tampering.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Limitations: The default daily limit for Google Play Services Integrity Verification API requests is 10,000 requests per day. Applications needing more must contact Google to request an increased limit.</p> <p>Example Request: </p> <pre><code>{  \n\u00a0 \u00a0\"requestDetails\": {  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"requestPackageName\": \"com.example.your.package\",  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"timestampMillis\": \"1666025823025\",  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"nonce\": \"kx7QEkGebwQfBalJ4...Xwjhak7o3uHDDQTTqI\"  \n\u00a0 \u00a0},  \n\u00a0 \u00a0\"appIntegrity\": {  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"appRecognitionVerdict\": \"UNRECOGNIZED_VERSION\",  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"packageName\": \"com.example.your.package\",  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"certificateSha256Digest\": [  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"vNsB0...ww1U\"  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0],  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"versionCode\": \"1\"  \n\u00a0 \u00a0},  \n\u00a0 \u00a0\"deviceIntegrity\": {  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"deviceRecognitionVerdict\": [  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"MEETS_DEVICE_INTEGRITY\"  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0]  \n\u00a0 \u00a0},  \n\u00a0 \u00a0\"accountDetails\": {  \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"appLicensingVerdict\": \"UNEVALUATED\"  \n\u00a0 \u00a0}  \n\u00a0}  \n</code></pre>","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05j-Testing-Resiliency-Against-Reverse-Engineering/#programmatic-detection","title":"Programmatic Detection","text":"","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05j-Testing-Resiliency-Against-Reverse-Engineering/#file-existence-checks","title":"File existence checks","text":"<p>Perhaps the most widely used method of programmatic detection is checking for files typically found on rooted devices, such as package files of common rooting apps and their associated files and directories, including the following:</p> <pre><code>/system/app/Superuser.apk\n/system/etc/init.d/99SuperSUDaemon\n/dev/com.koushikdutta.superuser.daemon/\n/system/xbin/daemonsu\n</code></pre> <p>Detection code also often looks for binaries that are usually installed once a device has been rooted.

Therefore, there are different ways that an app may implement to detect a reverse engineering attack and react to it, e.g. by terminating itself.</p> <p>You can detect popular reverse engineering tools that have been installed in an unmodified form by looking for associated application packages, files, processes, or other tool-specific modifications and artifacts. In the following examples, we'll discuss different ways to detect the Frida instrumentation framework, which is used extensively in this guide. Other tools, such as Substrate and Xposed, can be detected similarly. Note that DBI/injection/hooking tools can often be detected implicitly, through runtime integrity checks, which are discussed below.</p> <p>For instance, in its default configuration on a rooted device, Frida runs on the device as frida-server. When you explicitly attach to a target app (e.g. via frida-trace or the Frida REPL), Frida injects a frida-agent into the memory of the app. Therefore, you may expect to find it there after attaching to the app (and not before). If you check <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</code> you'll find the frida-agent as frida-agent-64.so:</p> <pre><code>bullhead:/ # cat /proc/18370/maps | grep -i frida\n71b6bd6000-71b7d62000 r-xp  /data/local/tmp/re.frida.server/frida-agent-64.so\n71b7d7f000-71b7e06000 r--p  /data/local/tmp/re.frida.server/frida-agent-64.so\n71b7e06000-71b7e28000 rw-p  /data/local/tmp/re.frida.server/frida-agent-64.so\n</code></pre> <p>The other method (which also works for non-rooted devices) consists of embedding a frida-gadget into the APK and forcing the app to load it as one of its native libraries. If you inspect the app memory maps after starting the app (no need to attach explicitly to it) you'll find the embedded frida-gadget as libfrida-gadget.so.</p> <pre><code>bullhead:/ # cat /proc/18370/maps | grep -i frida\n\n71b865a000-71b97f1000 r-xp  /data/app/sg.vp.owasp_mobile.omtg_android-.../lib/arm64/libfrida-gadget.so\n71b9802000-71b988a000 r--p  /data/app/sg.vp.owasp_mobile.omtg_android-.../lib/arm64/libfrida-gadget.so\n71b988a000-71b98ac000 rw-p  /data/app/sg.vp.owasp_mobile.omtg_android-.../lib/arm64/libfrida-gadget.so\n</code></pre> <p>Looking at these two traces that Frida lefts behind, you might already imagine that detecting those would be a trivial task. And actually, so trivial will be bypassing that detection. But things can get much more complicated. The following table shortly presents a set of some typical Frida detection methods and a short discussion on their effectiveness.</p> <p>Some of the following detection methods are presented in the article \"The Jiu-Jitsu of Detecting Frida\" by Berdhard Mueller (archived). Please refer to it for more details and for example code snippets.</p> Method Description Discussion Checking the App Signature In order to embed the frida-gadget within the APK, it would need to be repackaged and resigned. You could check the signature of the APK when the app is starting (e.g. GET_SIGNING_CERTIFICATES since API level 28) and compare it to the one you pinned in your APK. This is unfortunately too trivial to bypass, e.g. by patching the APK or performing system call hooking. Check The Environment For Related Artifacts Artifacts can be package files, binaries, libraries, processes, and temporary files. For Frida, this could be the frida-server running in the target (rooted) system (the daemon responsible for exposing Frida over TCP). Inspect the running services (<code>getRunningServices</code>) and processes (<code>ps</code>) searching for one whose name is \"frida-server\". You could also walk through the list of loaded libraries and check for suspicious ones (e.g. those including \"frida\" in their names). Since Android 7.0 (API level 24), inspecting the running services/processes won't show you daemons like the frida-server as it is not being started by the app itself. Even if it would be possible, bypassing this would be as easy just renaming the corresponding Frida artifact (frida-server/frida-gadget/frida-agent). Checking For Open TCP Ports The frida-server process binds to TCP port 27042 by default. Check whether this port is open is another method of detecting the daemon. This method detects frida-server in its default mode, but the listening port can be changed via a command line argument, so bypassing this is a little too trivial. Checking For Ports Responding To D-Bus Auth <code>frida-server</code> uses the D-Bus protocol to communicate, so you can expect it to respond to D-Bus AUTH. Send a D-Bus AUTH message to every open port and check for an answer, hoping that <code>frida-server</code> will reveal itself. This is a fairly robust method of detecting <code>frida-server</code>, but Frida offers alternative modes of operation that don't require frida-server. Scanning Process Memory for Known Artifacts Scan the memory for artifacts found in Frida's libraries, e.g. the string \"LIBFRIDA\" present in all versions of frida-gadget and frida-agent. For example, use <code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec</code> and iterate through the memory mappings listed in <code>/proc/self/maps</code> or <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</code> (depending on the Android version) searching for the string. This method is a bit more effective, and it is difficult to bypass with Frida only, especially if some obfuscation has been added and if multiple artifacts are being scanned. However, the chosen artifacts might be patched in the Frida binaries. Find the source code on Berdhard Mueller's GitHub. <p>Please remember that this table is far from exhaustive. We could start talking about named pipes (used by frida-server for external communication), detecting trampolines (indirect jump vectors inserted at the prologue of functions), which would help detecting Substrate or Frida's Interceptor but, for example, won't be effective against Frida's Stalker; and many other, more or less, effective detection methods. Each of them will depend on whether you're using a rooted device, the specific version of the rooting method and/or the version of the tool itself. Further, the app can try to make it harder to detect the implemented protection mechanisms by using various obfuscation techniques. At the end, this is part of the cat and mouse game of protecting data being processed on an untrusted environment (an app running in the user device).</p> <p>It is important to note that these controls are only increasing the complexity of the reverse engineering process. If used, the best approach is to combine the controls cleverly instead of using them individually. However, none of them can assure a 100% effectiveness, as the reverse engineer will always have full access to the device and will therefore always win! You also have to consider that integrating some of the controls into your app might increase the complexity of your app and even have an impact on its performance.</p>","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05j-Testing-Resiliency-Against-Reverse-Engineering/#emulator-detection","title":"Emulator Detection","text":"<p>In the context of anti-reversing, the goal of emulator detection is to increase the difficulty of running the app on an emulated device, which impedes some tools and techniques reverse engineers like to use.

With the flag <code>-keep</code> you can keep certain code that is not being removed by R8, which might otherwise produce errors. For example to keep common Android classes, as in our sample configuration <code>proguard-rules.pro</code> file:</p> <pre><code>...\n-keep public class * extends android.app.Activity\n-keep public class * extends android.app.Application\n-keep public class * extends android.app.Service\n...\n</code></pre> <p>You can define this more granularly on specific classes or libraries in your project with the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>-keep public class MyClass\n</code></pre> <p>Obfuscation often carries a cost in runtime performance, therefore it is usually only applied to certain very specific parts of the code, typically those dealing with security and runtime protection.</p>","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","android"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x05j-Testing-Resiliency-Against-Reverse-Engineering/#device-binding","title":"Device Binding","text":"<p>The goal of device binding is to impede an attacker who tries to both copy an app and its state from device A to device B and continue executing the app on device B.

It is also the basis for Apple tvOS, which inherits many functionalities from iOS. This section introduces the iOS platform from an architecture point of view. The following five key areas are discussed:</p> <ol> <li>iOS security architecture</li> <li>iOS application structure</li> <li>Inter-process Communication (IPC)</li> <li>iOS application publishing</li> <li>iOS Application Attack Surface</li> </ol> <p>Like the Apple desktop operating system macOS (formerly OS X), iOS is based on Darwin, an open source Unix operating system developed by Apple. Darwin's kernel is XNU (\"X is Not Unix\"), a hybrid kernel that combines components of the Mach and FreeBSD kernels.</p> <p>However, iOS apps run in a more restricted environment than their desktop counterparts do. iOS apps are isolated from each other at the file system level and are significantly limited in terms of system API access.</p> <p>To protect users from malicious applications, Apple restricts and controls access to the apps that are allowed to run on iOS devices. Apple's App Store is the only official application distribution platform. There developers can offer their apps and consumers can buy, download, and install apps. This distribution style differs from Android, which supports several app stores and sideloading (installing an app on your iOS device without using the official App Store). In iOS, sideloading typically refers to the app installation method via USB, although there are other enterprise iOS app distribution methods that do not use the App Store under the Apple Developer Enterprise Program.</p> <p>In the past, sideloading was possible only with a jailbreak or complicated workarounds. With iOS 9 or higher, it is possible to sideload via Xcode.</p> <p>iOS apps are isolated from each other via Apple's iOS sandbox (historically called Seatbelt), a mandatory access control (MAC) mechanism describing the resources an app can and can't access. Compared to Android's extensive Binder IPC facilities, iOS offers very few IPC (Inter Process Communication) options, minimizing the potential attack surface.</p> <p>Uniform hardware and tight hardware/software integration create another security advantage. Every iOS device offers security features, such as secure boot, hardware-backed Keychain, and file system encryption (referred as data protection in iOS). iOS updates are usually quickly rolled out to a large percentage of users, decreasing the need to support older, unprotected iOS versions.</p> <p>In spite of the numerous strengths of iOS, iOS app developers still need to worry about security. Data protection, Keychain, Touch ID/Face ID authentication, and network security still leave a large margin for errors.

There's no direct way to read these keys with software or debugging interfaces such as JTAG. Encryption and decryption operations are performed by hardware AES crypto-engines that have exclusive access to these keys.</p> <p>The GID is a value shared by all processors in a class of devices used to prevent tampering with firmware files and other cryptographic tasks not directly related to the user's private data. UIDs, which are unique to each device, are used to protect the key hierarchy that's used for device-level file system encryption.

Next, the Boot ROM makes sure that the LLB's (Low Level Bootloader) signature is correct, and the LLB checks that the iBoot bootloader's signature is correct too. After the signature is validated, the iBoot checks the signature of the next boot stage, which is the iOS kernel. If any of these steps fail, the boot process will terminate immediately and the device will enter recovery mode and display the restore screen. However, if the Boot ROM fails to load, the device will enter a special low-level recovery mode called Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU). This is the last resort for restoring the device to its original state. In this mode, the device will show no sign of activity; i.e., its screen won't display anything.</p> <p>This entire process is called the \"Secure Boot Chain\".

FairPlay was developed as a DRM when purchasing multimedia content. Originally, FairPlay encryption was applied to MPEG and QuickTime streams, but the same basic concepts can also be applied to executable files. The basic idea is as follows: Once you register a new Apple user account, or Apple ID, a public/private key pair will be created and assigned to your account. The private key is securely stored on your device. This means that FairPlay-encrypted code can be decrypted only on devices associated with your account. Reverse FairPlay encryption is usually obtained by running the app on the device, then dumping the decrypted code from memory (see also \"Basic Security Testing on iOS\").</p> <p>Apple has built encryption into the hardware and firmware of its iOS devices since the release of the iPhone 3GS. Every device has a dedicated hardware-based cryptographic engine that provides an implementation of the AES 256-bit encryption and the SHA-1 hashing algorithms. In addition, there's a unique identifier (UID) built into each device's hardware with an AES 256-bit key fused into the Application Processor. This UID is unique and not recorded elsewhere. At the time of writing, neither software nor firmware can directly read the UID. Because the key is burned into the silicon chip, it can't be tampered with or bypassed. Only the crypto engine can access it.</p> <p>Building encryption into the physical architecture makes it a default security feature that can encrypt all data stored on an iOS device. As a result, data protection is implemented at the software level and works with the hardware and firmware encryption to provide more security.</p> <p>When data protection is enabled, by simply establishing a passcode in the mobile device, each data file is associated with a specific protection class. Each class supports a different level of accessibility and protects data on the basis of when the data needs to be accessed. The encryption and decryption operations associated with each class are based on multiple key mechanisms that utilize the device's UID and passcode, a class key, a file system key, and a per-file key. The per-file key is used to encrypt the file's contents. The class key is wrapped around the per-file key and stored in the file's metadata. The file system key is used to encrypt the metadata. The UID and passcode protect the class key. This operation is invisible to users. To enable data protection, the passcode must be used when accessing the device. The passcode unlocks the device. Combined with the UID, the passcode also creates iOS encryption keys that are more resistant to hacking and brute-force attacks.

To explain the difference, we'll first review the concepts of \"rooting\" and \"flashing\" on Android.</p> <ul> <li>Rooting: This typically involves installing the <code>su</code> binary on the system or replacing the whole system with a rooted custom ROM. Exploits aren't required to obtain root access as long as the bootloader is accessible.</li> <li>Flashing custom ROMs: This allows you to replace the OS that's running on the device after you unlock the bootloader. The bootloader may require an exploit to unlock it.</li> </ul> <p>On iOS devices, flashing a custom ROM is impossible because the iOS bootloader only allows Apple-signed images to be booted and flashed. This is why even official iOS images can't be installed if they aren't signed by Apple, and it makes iOS downgrades only possible for as long as the previous iOS version is still signed.</p> <p>The purpose of jailbreaking is to disable iOS protections (Apple's code signing mechanisms in particular) so that arbitrary unsigned code can run on the device (e.g. custom code or downloaded from alternative app stores such as Cydia or Sileo). The word \"jailbreak\" is a colloquial reference to all-in-one tools that automate the disabling process.</p> <p>Developing a jailbreak for a given version of iOS is not easy. As a security tester, you'll most likely want to use publicly available jailbreak tools. Still, we recommend studying the techniques that have been used to jailbreak various versions of iOS-you'll encounter many interesting exploits and learn a lot about OS internals. For example, Pangu9 for iOS 9.x exploited at least five vulnerabilities, including a use-after-free kernel bug (CVE-2015-6794) and an arbitrary file system access vulnerability in the Photos app (CVE-2015-7037).</p> <p>Some apps attempt to detect whether the iOS device on which they're running is jailbroken.

Whenever Apple becomes aware of a vulnerability, it is patched and a system update is pushed out to all users. As it is not possible to downgrade to a specific version of iOS, and since Apple only allows you to update to the latest iOS version, it is a challenge to have a device which is running a version of iOS for which a jailbreak is available. Some vulnerabilities cannot be patched by software, such as the checkm8 exploit affecting the BootROM of all CPUs until A12.</p> <p>If you have a jailbroken device that you use for security testing, keep it as is unless you're 100% sure that you can re-jailbreak it after upgrading to the latest iOS version. Consider getting one (or multiple) spare device(s) (which will be updated with every major iOS release) and waiting for a jailbreak to be released publicly. Apple is usually quick to release a patch once a jailbreak has been released publicly, so you only have a couple of days to downgrade (if it is still signed by Apple) to the affected iOS version and apply the jailbreak.</p> <p>iOS upgrades are based on a challenge-response process (generating the so-called SHSH blobs as a result). The device will allow the OS installation only if the response to the challenge is signed by Apple. This is what researchers call a \"signing window\", and it is the reason you can't simply store the OTA firmware package you downloaded and load it onto the device whenever you want to. During minor iOS upgrades, two versions may both be signed by Apple (the latest one, and the previous iOS version). This is the only situation in which you can downgrade the iOS device. You can check the current signing window and download OTA firmware from the IPSW Downloads website.</p> <p>For some devices and iOS versions, it is possible to downgrade to older versions in case the SHSH blobs for that device were collected when the signing window was active.

The UID and the user passcode key (which is derived from the user's passphrase via the PBKDF2 algorithm) sit at the top of this hierarchy. Together, they can be used to \"unlock\" so-called class keys, which are associated with different device states (e.g., device locked/unlocked).</p> <p>Every file stored on the iOS file system is encrypted with its own per-file key, which is contained in the file metadata.

The structure of the Keychain on iOS is different: only one Keychain is available to all apps. Access to the items can be shared between apps signed by the same developer via the access groups feature of the attribute <code>kSecAttrAccessGroup</code>. Access to the Keychain is managed by the <code>securityd</code> daemon, which grants access according to the app's <code>Keychain-access-groups</code>, <code>application-identifier</code>, and <code>application-group</code> entitlements.</p> <p>The Keychain API includes the following main operations:</p> <ul> <li><code>SecItemAdd</code></li> <li><code>SecItemUpdate</code></li> <li><code>SecItemCopyMatching</code></li> <li><code>SecItemDelete</code></li> </ul> <p>Data stored in the Keychain is protected via a class structure that is similar to the class structure used for file encryption.

Note that larger blobs of data aren't meant to be saved directly in the Keychain-that's what the Data Protection API is for. You can configure data protection for Keychain items by setting the <code>kSecAttrAccessible</code> key in the call to <code>SecItemAdd</code> or <code>SecItemUpdate</code>. The following configurable accessibility values for kSecAttrAccessible are the Keychain Data Protection classes:</p> <ul> <li><code>kSecAttrAccessibleAlways</code>: The data in the Keychain item can always be accessed, regardless of whether the device is locked.</li> <li><code>kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly</code>: The data in the Keychain item can always be accessed, regardless of whether the device is locked.

In that scenario, the private key and the cryptographic operations reside within the Secure Enclave. See the static analysis section for more info on creating the ECC keys. iOS 9 supports only 256-bit ECC. Furthermore, you need to store the public key in the Keychain because it can't be stored in the Secure Enclave.

However, it can also be used to access to sensitive data. This section describes how to check process' memory for data disclosure.</p> <p>First, identify the sensitive information that's stored in memory. Sensitive assets are very likely to be loaded into memory at some point. The objective is to make sure that this info is exposed as briefly as possible.</p> <p>To investigate an application's memory, first create a memory dump. Alternatively, you can analyze the memory in real time with, for example, a debugger. Regardless of the method you use, this is a very error-prone process because dumps provide the data left by executed functions and you might miss executing critical steps. In addition, overlooking data during analysis is quite easy to do unless you know the footprint of the data you're looking for (either its exact value or its format). For example, if the app encrypts according to a randomly generated symmetric key, you're very unlikely to spot the key in memory unless you find its value by other means.</p> <p>Before looking into the source code, checking the documentation and identifying application components provide an overview of where data might be exposed. For example, while sensitive data received from a backend exists in the final model object, multiple copies may also exist in the HTTP client or the XML parser. All these copies should be removed from memory as soon as possible.</p> <p>Understanding the application's architecture and its interaction with the OS will help you identify sensitive information that doesn't have to be exposed in memory at all. For example, assume your app receives data from one server and transfers it to another without needing any additional processing. That data can be received and handled in encrypted form, which prevents exposure via memory.</p> <p>However, if sensitive data does need to be exposed via memory, make sure that your app exposes as few copies of this data as possible for as little time as possible. In other words, you want centralized handling of sensitive data, based on primitive and mutable data structures.</p> <p>Such data structures give developers direct access to memory. Make sure that this access is used to overwrite the sensitive data and cryptographic keys with zeroes. Apple Secure Coding Guide suggests zeroing sensitive data after usage, but provides no recommended ways of doing this.</p> <p>Examples of preferable data types include <code>char []</code> and <code>int []</code>, but not <code>NSString</code> or <code>String</code>. Whenever you try to modify an immutable object, such as a <code>String</code>, you actually create a copy and change the copy. Consider using <code>NSMutableData</code> for storing secrets on Swift/Objective-C and use <code>resetBytes(in:)</code> method for zeroing. Also, see Clean memory of secret data for reference.</p> <p>Avoid Swift data types other than collections regardless of whether they are considered mutable. Many Swift data types hold their data by value, not by reference. Although this allows modification of the memory allocated to simple types like <code>char</code> and <code>int</code>, handling a complex type such as <code>String</code> by value involves a hidden layer of objects, structures, or primitive arrays whose memory can't be directly accessed or modified. Certain types of usage may seem to create a mutable data object (and even be documented as doing so), but they actually create a mutable identifier (variable) instead of an immutable identifier (constant). For example, many think that the following results in a mutable <code>String</code> in Swift, but this is actually an example of a variable whose complex value can be changed (replaced, not modified in place):</p> <pre><code>var str1 = \"Goodbye\"              // \"Goodbye\", base address:            0x0001039e8dd0\nstr1.append(\" \")                 // \"Goodbye \", base address:            0x608000064ae0\nstr1.append(\"cruel world!\")      // \"Goodbye cruel world\", base address: 0x6080000338a0\nstr1.removeAll()                 // \"\", base address                    0x00010bd66180\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that the base address of the underlying value changes with each string operation. Here is the problem: To securely erase the sensitive information from memory, we don't want to simply change the value of the variable; we want to change the actual content of the memory allocated for the current value. Swift doesn't offer such a function.</p> <p>Swift collections (<code>Array</code>, <code>Set</code>, and <code>Dictionary</code>), on the other hand, may be acceptable if they collect primitive data types such as <code>char</code> or <code>int</code> and are defined as mutable (i.e., as variables instead of constants), in which case they are more or less equivalent to a primitive array (such as <code>char []</code>). These collections provide memory management, which can result in unidentified copies of the sensitive data in memory if the collection needs to copy the underlying buffer to a different location to extend it.</p> <p>Using mutable Objective-C data types, such as <code>NSMutableString</code>, may also be acceptable, but these types have the same memory issue as Swift collections. Pay attention when using Objective-C collections; they hold data by reference, and only Objective-C data types are allowed. Therefore, we are looking, not for a mutable collection, but for a collection that references mutable objects.</p> <p>As we've seen so far, using Swift or Objective-C data types requires a deep understanding of the language implementation. Furthermore, there has been some core re-factoring in between major Swift versions, resulting in many data types' behavior being incompatible with that of other types. To avoid these issues, we recommend using primitive data types whenever data needs to be securely erased from memory.</p> <p>Unfortunately, few libraries and frameworks are designed to allow sensitive data to be overwritten. Not even Apple considers this issue in the official iOS SDK API. For example, most of the APIs for data transformation (passers, serializes, etc.) operate on non-primitive data types. Similarly, regardless of whether you flag some <code>UITextField</code> as Secure Text Entry or not, it always returns data in the form of a <code>String</code> or <code>NSString</code>.</p>","tags":["MASVS-STORAGE","ios"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x06d-Testing-Data-Storage/#ipc","title":"IPC","text":"<p>Inter Process Communication (IPC) allows processes to send each other messages and data.

The app can't access any data associated with the enrolled fingerprint and is notified only whether authentication was successful.</li> <li><code>Security.framework</code> is a lower level API to access keychain services. This is a secure option if your app needs to protect some secret data with biometric authentication, since the access control is managed on a system-level and can not easily be bypassed. <code>Security.framework</code> has a C API, but there are several open source wrappers available, making access to the keychain as simple as to NSUserDefaults. <code>Security.framework</code> underlies  <code>LocalAuthentication.framework</code>; Apple recommends to default to higher-level APIs whenever possible.</li> </ul> <p>Please be aware that using either the <code>LocalAuthentication.framework</code> or the <code>Security.framework</code>, will be a control that can be bypassed by an attacker as it does only return a boolean and no data to proceed with.

Note that <code>Data</code> in Swift is the same as <code>NSData</code> or its mutable counterpart: <code>NSMutableData</code>. The <code>NSCoding</code> protocol declares the two methods that must be implemented in order to encode/decode its instance-variables.

Each app has a unique home directory and is sandboxed, so that they cannot access protected system resources or files stored by the system or by other apps. These restrictions are implemented via sandbox policies (aka. profiles), which are enforced by the Trusted BSD (MAC) Mandatory Access Control Framework via a kernel extension. iOS applies a generic sandbox profile to all third-party apps called container. Access to protected resources or data (some also known as app capabilities) is possible, but it's strictly controlled via special permissions known as entitlements.</p> <p>Some permissions can be configured by the app's developers (e.g. Data Protection or Keychain Sharing) and will directly take effect after the installation. However, for others, the user will be explicitly asked the first time the app attempts to access a protected resource, for example:</p> <ul> <li>Bluetooth peripherals</li> <li>Calendar data</li> <li>Camera</li> <li>Contacts</li> <li>Health sharing</li> <li>Health updating</li> <li>HomeKit</li> <li>Location</li> <li>Microphone</li> <li>Motion</li> <li>Music and the media library</li> <li>Photos</li> <li>Reminders</li> <li>Siri</li> <li>Speech recognition</li> <li>the TV provider</li> </ul> <p>Even though Apple urges to protect the privacy of the user and to be very clear on how to ask permissions, it can still be the case that an app requests too many of them for non-obvious reasons.</p> <p>Verifying the use of some permissions such as Camera, Photos, Calendar Data, Motion, Contacts or Speech Recognition should be pretty straightforward as it should be obvious if the app requires them to fulfill its tasks. Let's consider the following examples regarding the Photos permission, which, if granted, gives the app access to all user photos in the \"Camera Roll\" (the iOS default system-wide location for storing photos):</p> <ul> <li>The typical QR Code scanning app obviously requires the camera to function but might be requesting the photos permission as well. If storage is explicitly required, and depending on the sensitivity of the pictures being taken, these apps might better opt to use the app sandbox storage to avoid other apps (having the photos permission) to access them. See the chapter \"Data Storage on iOS\" for more information regarding storage of sensitive data.</li> <li>Some apps require photo uploads (e.g. for profile pictures). Recent versions of iOS introduce new APIs such as <code>UIImagePickerController</code> (iOS 11+) and its modern replacement <code>PHPickerViewController</code> (iOS 14+). These APIs run on a separate process from your app and by using them, the app gets read-only access exclusively to the images selected by the user instead of to the whole \"Camera Roll\". This is considered a best practice to avoid requesting unnecessary permissions.</li> </ul> <p>Verifying other permissions like Bluetooth or Location require a deeper source code inspection. They may be required for the app to properly function but the data being handled by those tasks might not be properly protected.</p> <p>When collecting or simply handling (e.g. caching) sensitive data, an app should provide proper mechanisms to give the user control over it, e.g. to be able to revoke access or to delete it. However, sensitive data might not only be stored or cached but also sent over the network. In both cases, it has to be ensured that the app properly follows the appropriate best practices, which in this case involve implementing proper data protection and transport security. More information on how to protect this kind of data can be found in the chapter \"Network APIs\".</p> <p>As you can see, using app capabilities and permissions mostly involve handling personal data, therefore being a matter of protecting the user's privacy.

And while it is trivial to detect these libraries, it is equally trivial to bypass such a detection. Detection of tools is a cat and mouse game and things can get much more complicated. The following table shortly presents a set of some typical Frida detection methods and a short discussion on their effectiveness.</p> <p>Some of the following detection methods are implemented in the iOS Security Suite.</p> Method Description Discussion Check The Environment For Related Artifacts Artifacts can be packaged files, binaries, libraries, processes, and temporary files. For Frida, this could be the frida-server running in the target (jailbroken) system (the daemon responsible for exposing Frida over TCP) or the frida libraries loaded by the app. Inspecting running services is not possible for an iOS app on a non-jailbroken device. The Swift method CommandLine is not available on iOS to query for information about running processes, but there are unofficial ways, such as by using NSTask. Nevertheless when using this method, the app will be rejected during the App Store review process. There is no other public API available to query for running processes or execute system commands within an iOS App. Even if it would be possible, bypassing this would be as easy as just renaming the corresponding Frida artifact (frida-server/frida-gadget/frida-agent). Another way to detect Frida, would be to walk through the list of loaded libraries and check for suspicious ones (e.g. those including \"frida\" in their names), which can be done by using <code>_dyld_get_image_name</code>. Checking For Open TCP Ports The frida-server process binds to TCP port 27042 by default. Testing whether this port is open is another method of detecting the daemon. This method detects frida-server in its default mode, but the listening port can be changed via a command line argument, so bypassing this is very trivial. Checking For Ports Responding To D-Bus Auth <code>frida-server</code> uses the D-Bus protocol to communicate, so you can expect it to respond to D-Bus AUTH. Send a D-Bus AUTH message to every open port and check for an answer, hoping that <code>frida-server</code> will reveal itself. This is a fairly robust method of detecting <code>frida-server</code>, but Frida offers alternative modes of operation that don't require frida-server. <p>Please remember that this table is far from exhaustive.

This forces the reverse engineer to defeat the emulator checks or utilize the physical device, thereby barring the access required for large-scale device analysis.</p> <p>As discussed in the section Testing on the iOS Simulator in the basic security testing chapter, the only available simulator is the one that ships with Xcode. Simulator binaries are compiled to x86 code instead of ARM code and apps compiled for a real device (ARM architecture) don't run in the simulator, hence simulation protection was not so much a concern regarding iOS apps in contrast to Android with a wide range of emulation choices available.</p> <p>However, since its release, Corellium (commercial tool) has enabled real emulation, setting itself apart from the iOS simulator. In addition to that, being a SaaS solution, Corellium enables large-scale device analysis with the limiting factor just being available funds.</p> <p>With Apple Silicon (ARM) hardware widely available, traditional checks for the presence of x86 / x64 architecture might not suffice. One potential detection strategy is to identify features and limitations available for commonly used emulation solutions. For instance, Corellium doesn't support iCloud, cellular services, camera, NFC, Bluetooth, App Store access or GPU hardware emulation (Metal). Therefore, smartly combining checks involving any of these features could be an indicator for the presence of an emulated environment.</p> <p>Pairing these results with the ones from 3rd party frameworks such as iOS Security Suite, Trusteer or a no-code solution such as Appdome (commercial solution) will provide a good line of defense against attacks utilizing emulators.</p>","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","ios"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x06j-Testing-Resiliency-Against-Reverse-Engineering/#obfuscation","title":"Obfuscation","text":"<p>The chapter \"Mobile App Tampering and Reverse Engineering\" introduces several well-known obfuscation techniques that can be used in mobile apps in general.</p>","tags":["MASVS-RESILIENCE","ios"]},{"location":"MASTG/0x06j-Testing-Resiliency-Against-Reverse-Engineering/#name-obfuscation","title":"Name Obfuscation","text":"<p>The standard compiler generates binary symbols based on class and function names from the source code.

For this reason, we have historically avoided including such tools due to the competitive disadvantages they can create among vendors.

The samples are written in Kotlin or Swift, depending on the platform. In some cases, the samples will also include configuration files such as <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> or <code>Info.plist</code>.</p> <p>If the sample can be decompiled, the decompiled code is also provided in the demo. This is useful for understanding the code in the context of the application.</p> <p>Demos are required to be fully self-contained and should not rely on external resources or dependencies. This ensures that the demos can be run independently and that the results are reproducible. They must be proven to work on the provided sample applications and must be tested thoroughly before being included in the MASTG.</p> <p>MAS Test Apps</p> <p>In order for our new demos to be reliable and consistent, we needed to make sure that the results were reproducible and could be tested and validated. This is where the new MASTestApps came in. They are two very simple apps that mirror each other on Android and iOS. Demos must be implemented using these apps.

Still, this can come handy in some scenarios where you're already exploring the app using objection anyway and find some interesting file. Instead of for example taking note of the full path of that file and use <code>adb pull &lt;path_to_some_file&gt;</code> from a separate terminal, you might just want to directly do <code>file download &lt;some_file&gt;</code>.</p>","tags":["android"]},{"location":"MASTG/techniques/android/MASTG-TECH-0003/","title":"MASTG-TECH-0003: Obtaining and Extracting Apps","text":"<p>There are several ways of extracting APK files from a device.

They do not require any form of installation. There are a few challenges with an instant app:</p> <ul> <li>There is a limited amount of size you can have with an instant app.</li> <li>Only a reduced number of permissions can be used, which are documented at Android Instant app documentation.</li> </ul> <p>The combination of these can lead to insecure decisions, such as: stripping too much of the authorization/authentication/confidentiality logic from an app, which allows for information leakage.</p> <p>Note: Instant apps require an App Bundle. App Bundles are described in the \"App Bundles\" section of the \"Android Platform Overview\" chapter.</p> <p>Static Analysis Considerations:</p> <p>Static analysis can be either done after reverse engineering a downloaded instant app, or by analyzing the App Bundle. When you analyze the App Bundle, check the Android Manifest to see whether <code>dist:module dist:instant=\"true\"</code> is set for a given module (either the base or a specific module with <code>dist:module</code> set).

This also applies to applications that contain native code. They can still be reverse engineered, but the process is not automated and requires knowledge of low-level details.</p> <p>If you want to look directly into Java source code on a GUI, simply open your APK using jadx or Bytecode Viewer.</p> <p>Android decompilers go one step further and attempt to convert Android bytecode back into Java source code, making it more human-readable.

First, unzip the APK file (<code>unzip UnCrackable-Level1.apk -d UnCrackable-Level1</code>) and look at the content. In the standard setup, all the Java bytecode and app data is in the file <code>classes.dex</code> in the app root directory (<code>UnCrackable-Level1/</code>). This file conforms to the Dalvik Executable Format (DEX), an Android-specific way of packaging Java programs. Most Java decompilers take plain class files or JARs as input, so you need to convert the classes.dex file into a JAR first. You can do this with <code>dex2jar</code> or <code>enjarify</code>.</p> <p>Once you have a JAR file, you can use any free decompiler to produce Java code. In this example, we'll use the CFR decompiler. CFR releases are available on the author's website. CFR was released under an MIT license, so you can use it freely even though its source code is not available.</p> <p>The easiest way to run CFR is through apkx, which also packages <code>dex2jar</code> and automates extraction, conversion, and decompilation. Run it on the APK and you should find the decompiled sources in the directory <code>Uncrackable-Level1/src</code>. To view the sources, a simple text editor (preferably with syntax highlighting) is fine, but loading the code into a Java IDE makes navigation easier. Let's import the code into IntelliJ, which also provides on-device debugging functionality.</p> <p>Open IntelliJ and select \"Android\" as the project type in the left tab of the \"New Project\" dialog. Enter \"Uncrackable1\" as the application name and \"vantagepoint.sg\" as the company name. This results in the package name \"sg.vantagepoint.uncrackable1\", which matches the original package name. Using a matching package name is important if you want to attach the debugger to the running app later on because IntelliJ uses the package name to identify the correct process.</p> <p></p> <p>In the next dialog, pick any API number; you don't actually want to compile the project, so the number doesn't matter. Click \"next\" and choose \"Add no Activity\", then click \"finish\".</p> <p>Once you have created the project, expand the \"1: Project\" view on the left and navigate to the folder <code>app/src/main/java</code>. Right-click and delete the default package \"sg.vantagepoint.uncrackable1\" created by IntelliJ.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, open the <code>Uncrackable-Level1/src</code> directory in a file browser and drag the <code>sg</code> directory into the now empty <code>Java</code> folder in the IntelliJ project view (hold the \"alt\" key to copy the folder instead of moving it).</p> <p></p> <p>You'll end up with a structure that resembles the original Android Studio project from which the app was built.</p> <p></p> <p>See the section \"Reviewing Decompiled Java Code\" below to learn on how to proceed when inspecting the decompiled Java code.</p>","tags":["android"]},{"location":"MASTG/techniques/android/MASTG-TECH-0018/","title":"MASTG-TECH-0018: Disassembling Native Code","text":"<p>Dalvik and ART both support the Java Native Interface (JNI), which defines a way for Java code to interact with native code written in C/C++. As on other Linux-based operating systems, native code is packaged (compiled) into ELF dynamic libraries (*.so), which the Android app loads at runtime via the <code>System.load</code> method. However, instead of relying on widely used C libraries (such as glibc), Android binaries are built against a custom libc named Bionic. Bionic adds support for important Android-specific services such as system properties and logging, and it is not fully POSIX-compatible.</p> <p>When reversing an Android application containing native code, we need to understand a couple of data structures related to the JNI bridge between Java and native code. From the reversing perspective, we need to be aware of two key data structures: <code>JavaVM</code> and <code>JNIEnv</code>. Both of them are pointers to pointers to function tables:</p> <ul> <li><code>JavaVM</code> provides an interface to invoke functions for creating and destroying a JavaVM. Android allows only one <code>JavaVM</code> per process and is not really relevant for our reversing purposes.</li> <li><code>JNIEnv</code> provides access to most of the JNI functions which are accessible at a fixed offset through the <code>JNIEnv</code> pointer. This <code>JNIEnv</code> pointer is the first parameter passed to every JNI function. We will discuss this concept again with the help of an example later in this chapter.</li> </ul> <p>It is worth highlighting that analyzing disassembled native code is much more challenging than disassembled Java code. When reversing the native code in an Android application we will need a disassembler.</p> <p>In the next example we'll reverse the HelloWorld-JNI.apk from the OWASP MASTG repository. Installing and running it in an emulator or Android device is optional.</p> <pre><code>wget https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg/raw/master/Samples/Android/01_HelloWorld-JNI/HelloWord-JNI.apk\n</code></pre> <p>This app is not exactly spectacular, all it does is show a label with the text \"Hello from C++\". This is the app Android generates by default when you create a new project with C/C++ support, which is just enough to show the basic principles of JNI calls.</p> <p></p> <p>Decompile the APK with <code>apkx</code>.</p> <pre><code>$ apkx HelloWord-JNI.apk\nExtracting HelloWord-JNI.apk to HelloWord-JNI\nConverting: classes.dex -&gt; classes.jar (dex2jar)\ndex2jar HelloWord-JNI/classes.dex -&gt; HelloWord-JNI/classes.jar\nDecompiling to HelloWord-JNI/src (cfr)\n</code></pre> <p>This extracts the source code into the <code>HelloWord-JNI/src</code> directory. The main activity is found in the file <code>HelloWord-JNI/src/sg/vantagepoint/helloworldjni/MainActivity.java</code>. The \"Hello World\" text view is populated in the <code>onCreate</code> method:</p> <pre><code>public class MainActivity\nextends AppCompatActivity {\n    static {\n        System.loadLibrary(\"native-lib\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {\n        super.onCreate(bundle);\n        this.setContentView(2130968603);\n        ((TextView)this.findViewById(2131427422)).setText((CharSequence)this. \\\n        stringFromJNI());\n    }\n\n    public native String stringFromJNI();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note the declaration of <code>public native String stringFromJNI</code> at the bottom. The keyword \"native\" tells the Java compiler that this method is implemented in a native language. The corresponding function is resolved during runtime, but only if a native library that exports a global symbol with the expected signature is loaded (signatures comprise a package name, class name, and method name). In this example, this requirement is satisfied by the following C or C++ function:</p> <pre><code>JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL Java_sg_vantagepoint_helloworld_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(JNIEnv *env, jobject)\n</code></pre> <p>So where is the native implementation of this function? If you look into the \"lib\" directory of the unzipped APK archive, you'll see several subdirectories (one per supported processor architecture), each of them containing a version of the native library, in this case <code>libnative-lib.so</code>. When <code>System.loadLibrary</code> is called, the loader selects the correct version based on the device that the app is running on. Before moving ahead, pay attention to the first parameter passed to the current JNI function. It is the same <code>JNIEnv</code> data structure which was discussed earlier in this section.</p> <p></p> <p>Following the naming convention mentioned above, you can expect the library to export a symbol called <code>Java_sg_vantagepoint_helloworld_MainActivity_stringFromJNI</code>. On Linux systems, you can retrieve the list of symbols with <code>readelf</code> (included in GNU binutils) or <code>nm</code>. Do this on macOS with the <code>greadelf</code> tool, which you can install via Macports or Homebrew. The following example uses <code>greadelf</code>:</p> <pre><code>$ greadelf -W -s libnative-lib.so | grep Java\n     3: 00004e49   112 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   11 Java_sg_vantagepoint_helloworld_MainActivity_stringFromJNI\n</code></pre> <p>You can also see this using radare2's rabin2:</p> <pre><code>$ rabin2 -s HelloWord-JNI/lib/armeabi-v7a/libnative-lib.so | grep -i Java\n003 0x00000e78 0x00000e78 GLOBAL   FUNC   16 Java_sg_vantagepoint_helloworldjni_MainActivity_stringFromJNI\n</code></pre> <p>This is the native function that eventually gets executed when the <code>stringFromJNI</code> native method is called.</p> <p>To disassemble the code, you can load <code>libnative-lib.so</code> into any disassembler that understands ELF binaries (i.e., any disassembler). If the app ships with binaries for different architectures, you can theoretically pick the architecture you're most familiar with, as long as it is compatible with the disassembler. Each version is compiled from the same source and implements the same functionality. However, if you're planning to debug the library on a live device later, it's usually wise to pick an ARM build.</p> <p>To support both older and newer ARM processors, Android apps ship with multiple ARM builds compiled for different Application Binary Interface (ABI) versions. The ABI defines how the application's machine code is supposed to interact with the system at runtime. The following ABIs are supported:</p> <ul> <li>armeabi: ABI is for ARM-based CPUs that support at least the ARMv5TE instruction set.</li> <li>armeabi-v7a: This ABI extends armeabi to include several CPU instruction set extensions.</li> <li>arm64-v8a: ABI for ARMv8-based CPUs that support AArch64, the new 64-bit ARM architecture.</li> </ul> <p>Most disassemblers can handle any of those architectures.

Fortunately, cryptographic calls are very standard in nature, i.e, they need to be called in a particular order to work correctly, this knowledge can be helpful when analyzing cryptography APIs.

Even before you perform any dynamic analysis (e.g. traffic capture and analysis), you can obtain some initial inputs or entry points by enumerating the domains to which the application is supposed to communicate to.</p> <p>Typically these domains will be present as strings within the binary of the application. One way to achieve this is by using automated tools such as APKEnum or MobSF. Alternatively, you can grep for the domain names by using regular expressions. For this you can target the app binary directly or reverse engineer it and target the disassembled or decompiled code. The latter option has a clear advantage: it can provide you with context, as you'll be able to see in which context each domain is being used (e.g. class and method).</p> <p>From here on you can use this information to derive more insights which might be of use later during your analysis, e.g. you could match the domains to the pinned certificates or the Network Security Configuration file or perform further reconnaissance on domain names to know more about the target environment.

As soon as IntelliJ has indexed the code, you can browse it just like you'd browse any other Java project. Note that many of the decompiled packages, classes, and methods have weird one-letter names; this is because the bytecode has been \"minified\" with ProGuard at build time. This is a basic type of obfuscation that makes the bytecode a little more difficult to read, but with a fairly simple app like this one, it won't cause you much of a headache. When you're analyzing a more complex app, however, it can get quite annoying.</p> <p>When analyzing obfuscated code, annotating class names, method names, and other identifiers as you go along is a good practice. Open the <code>MainActivity</code> class in the package <code>sg.vantagepoint.uncrackable1</code>. The method <code>verify</code> is called when you tap the \"verify\" button. This method passes the user input to a static method called <code>a.a</code>, which returns a boolean value. It seems plausible that <code>a.a</code> verifies user input, so we'll refactor the code to reflect this.</p> <p></p> <p>Right-click the class name (the first <code>a</code> in <code>a.a</code>) and select Refactor -&gt; Rename from the drop-down menu (or press Shift-F6). Change the class name to something that makes more sense given what you know about the class so far. For example, you could call it \"Validator\" (you can always revise the name later). <code>a.a</code> now becomes <code>Validator.a</code>. Follow the same procedure to rename the static method <code>a</code> to <code>check_input</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Congratulations, you just learned the fundamentals of static analysis! It is all about theorizing, annotating, and gradually revising theories about the analyzed program until you understand it completely or, at least, well enough for whatever you want to achieve.</p> <p>Next, Ctrl+click (or Command+click on Mac) on the <code>check_input</code> method. This takes you to the method definition. The decompiled method looks like this:</p> <pre><code>    public static boolean check_input(String string) {\n        byte[] arrby = Base64.decode((String) \\\n        \"5UJiFctbmgbDoLXmpL12mkno8HT4Lv8dlat8FxR2GOc=\", (int)0);\n        byte[] arrby2 = new byte[]{};\n        try {\n            arrby = sg.vantagepoint.a.a.a(Validator.b(\"8d127684cbc37c17616d806cf50473cc\"), arrby);\n            arrby2 = arrby;\n        }sa\n        catch (Exception exception) {\n            Log.d((String)\"CodeCheck\", (String)(\"AES error:\" + exception.getMessage()));\n        }\n        if (string.equals(new String(arrby2))) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>So, you have a Base64-encoded String that's passed to the function <code>a</code> in the package \\ <code>sg.vantagepoint.a.a</code> (again, everything is called <code>a</code>) along with something that looks suspiciously like a hex-encoded encryption key (16 hex bytes = 128bit, a common key length). What exactly does this particular <code>a</code> do? Ctrl-click it to find out.</p> <pre><code>public class a {\n    public static byte[] a(byte[] object, byte[] arrby) {\n        object = new SecretKeySpec((byte[])object, \"AES/ECB/PKCS7Padding\");\n        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\");\n        cipher.init(2, (Key)object);\n        return cipher.doFinal(arrby);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now you're getting somewhere: it's simply standard AES-ECB. Looks like the Base64 string stored in <code>arrby1</code> in <code>check_input</code> is a ciphertext. It is decrypted with 128bit AES, then compared with the user input. As a bonus task, try to decrypt the extracted ciphertext and find the secret value!</p> <p>A faster way to get the decrypted string is to add dynamic analysis.

You can use its <code>adb jdwp</code> command to list the process IDs of all debuggable processes running on the connected device (i.e., processes hosting a JDWP transport).

Entering <code>?</code> prints the complete list of commands. Unfortunately, the Android VM doesn't support all available JDWP features. For example, the <code>redefine</code> command, which would let you redefine a class code is not supported. Another important restriction is that line breakpoints won't work because the release bytecode doesn't contain line information. Method breakpoints do work, however. Useful working commands include:</p> <ul> <li>classes: list all loaded classes</li> <li>class/methods/fields class id: Print details about a class and list its methods and fields</li> <li>locals: print local variables in current stack frame</li> <li>print/dump expr: print information about an object</li> <li>stop in method: set a method breakpoint</li> <li>clear method: remove a method breakpoint</li> <li>set lvalue = expr:  assign new value to field/variable/array element</li> </ul> <p>Let's revisit the decompiled code from the UnCrackable App for Android Level 1 and think about possible solutions. A good approach would be suspending the app in a state where the secret string is held in a variable in plain text so you can retrieve it. Unfortunately, you won't get that far unless you deal with the root/tampering detection first.</p> <p>Review the code and you'll see that the method <code>sg.vantagepoint.uncrackable1.MainActivity.a</code> displays the \"This in unacceptable...\" message box. This method creates an <code>AlertDialog</code> and sets a listener class for the <code>onClick</code> event. This class (named <code>b</code>) has a callback method will terminates the app once the user taps the OK button. To prevent the user from simply canceling the dialog, the <code>setCancelable</code> method is called.</p> <pre><code>  private void a(final String title) {\n        final AlertDialog create = new AlertDialog$Builder((Context)this).create();\n        create.setTitle((CharSequence)title);\n        create.setMessage((CharSequence)\"This in unacceptable.

In most cases, you should be able to single-step through the app and inspect the state of variables with the GUI. The experience won't be perfect, it's not the original source code after all, so you won't be able to set line breakpoints and things will sometimes simply not work correctly. Then again, reversing code is never easy, and efficiently navigating and debugging plain old Java code is a pretty convenient way of doing it. A similar method has been described in the NetSPI blog.</p> <p>To set up IDE debugging, first create your Android project in IntelliJ and copy the decompiled Java sources into the source folder as described above in the \"Reviewing Decompiled Java Code\" section. On the device, choose the app as debug app on the \"Developer options\" (UnCrackable App for Android Level 1 in this tutorial), and make sure you've switched on the \"Wait For Debugger\" feature.</p> <p>Once you tap the app icon from the launcher, it will be suspended in \"Wait For Debugger\" mode.</p> <p></p> <p>Now you can set breakpoints and attach to the app process with the \"Attach Debugger\" toolbar button.</p> <p></p> <p>Note that only method breakpoints work when debugging an app from decompiled sources. Once a method breakpoint is reached, you'll get the chance to single step during the method execution.</p> <p></p> <p>After you choose the app from the list, the debugger will attach to the app process and you'll reach the breakpoint that was set on the <code>onCreate</code> method. This app triggers anti-debugging and anti-tampering controls within the <code>onCreate</code> method. That's why setting a breakpoint on the <code>onCreate</code> method just before the anti-tampering and anti-debugging checks are performed is a good idea.</p> <p>Next, single-step through the <code>onCreate</code> method by clicking \"Force Step Into\" in Debugger view. The \"Force Step Into\" option allows you to debug the Android framework functions and core Java classes that are normally ignored by debuggers.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you \"Force Step Into\", the debugger will stop at the beginning of the next method, which is the <code>a</code> method of the class <code>sg.vantagepoint.a.c</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>This method searches for the \"su\" binary within a list of directories (<code>/system/xbin</code> and others). Since you're running the app on a rooted device/emulator, you need to defeat this check by manipulating variables and/or function return values.</p> <p>You can see the directory names inside the \"Variables\" window by clicking \"Step Over\" the Debugger view to step into and through the <code>a</code> method.</p> <p></p> <p>Step into the <code>System.getenv</code> method with the \"Force Step Into\" feature.</p> <p>After you get the colon-separated directory names, the debugger cursor will return to the beginning of the <code>a</code> method, not to the next executable line. This happens because you're working on the decompiled code instead of the source code. This skipping makes following the code flow crucial to debugging decompiled applications. Otherwise, identifying the next line to be executed would become complicated.</p> <p>If you don't want to debug core Java and Android classes, you can step out of the function by clicking \"Step Out\" in the Debugger view. Using \"Force Step Into\" might be a good idea once you reach the decompiled sources and \"Step Out\" of the core Java and Android classes. This will help speed up debugging while you keep an eye on the return values of the core class functions.</p> <p></p> <p>After the <code>a</code> method gets the directory names,  it will search for the <code>su</code> binary within these directories. To defeat this check, step through the detection method and inspect the variable content. Once execution reaches a location where the <code>su</code> binary would be detected, modify one of the variables holding the file name or directory name by pressing F2 or right-clicking and choosing \"Set Value\".</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Once you modify the binary name or the directory name, <code>File.exists</code> should return <code>false</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>This defeats the first root detection control of the app. The remaining anti-tampering and anti-debugging controls can be defeated in similar ways so that you can finally reach the secret string verification functionality.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The secret code is verified by the method <code>a</code> of class <code>sg.vantagepoint.uncrackable1.a</code>. Set a breakpoint on method <code>a</code> and \"Force Step Into\" when you reach the breakpoint. Then, single-step until you reach the call to <code>String.equals</code>.

There's a standalone tool called \"Traceview\" as well as a built-in viewer in Android Studio, both of which offer different ways to navigate the trace. You'll usually use Android studio's built-in viewer, which gives you a zoomable hierarchical timeline of all method calls. However, the standalone tool is also useful, it has a profile panel that shows the time spent in each method along with the parents and children of each method.</p> <p>To record an execution trace in Android Studio, open the Android tab at the bottom of the GUI. Select the target process in the list and click the little stop watch button on the left. This starts the recording. Once you're done, click the same button to stop the recording. The integrated trace view will open and show the recorded trace. You can scroll and zoom the timeline view with the mouse or trackpad.</p> <p>Execution traces can also be recorded in the standalone Android Device Monitor. The Device Monitor can be started within Android Studio (Tools -&gt; Android -&gt; Android Device Monitor) or from the shell with the <code>ddms</code> command.</p> <p>To start recording tracing information, select the target process in the Devices tab and click Start Method Profiling. Click the stop button to stop recording, after which the Traceview tool will open and show the recorded trace. Clicking any of the methods in the profile panel highlights the selected method in the timeline panel.</p> <p>DDMS also offers a convenient heap dump button that will dump the Java heap of a process to a .hprof file.

It makes tracing native functions trivial and can be very useful for collecting information about an application.</p> <p>In order to use <code>frida-trace</code>, a Frida server should be running on the device. An example for tracing libc's <code>open</code> function using <code>frida-trace</code> is demonstrated below, where <code>-U</code> connects to the USB device and <code>-i</code> specifies the function to be included in the trace.</p> <pre><code>frida-trace -U -i \"open\" com.android.chrome\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Note how, by default, only the arguments passed to the function are shown, but not the return values. Under the hood, <code>frida-trace</code> generates one little JavaScript handler file per matched function in the auto-generated <code>__handlers__</code> folder, which Frida then injects into the process. You can edit these files for more advanced usage such as obtaining the return value of the functions, their input parameters, accessing the memory, etc. Check Frida's JavaScript API for more details.</p> <p>In this case, the generated script which traces all calls to the <code>open</code> function in <code>libc.so</code> is located in <code>__handlers__/libc.so/open.js</code>, it looks as follows:</p> <pre><code>{\n  onEnter: function (log, args, state) {\n    log('open(' +\n      'path=\"' + args[0].readUtf8String() + '\"' +\n      ', oflag=' + args[1] +\n    ')');\n  },\n\n\n  onLeave: function (log, retval, state) {\n      log('\\t return: ' + retval);      \\\\ edited\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above script, <code>onEnter</code> takes care of logging the calls to this function and its two input parameters in the right format. You can edit the <code>onLeave</code> event to print the return values as shown above.</p> <p>Note that libc is a well-known library, Frida is able to derive the input parameters of its <code>open</code> function and automatically log them correctly. But this won't be the case for other libraries or for Android Kotlin/Java code. In that case, you may want to obtain the signatures of the functions you're interested in by referring to Android Developers documentation or by reverse engineer the app first.</p> <p>Another thing to notice in the output above is that it's colorized.

QEMU emulates a guest CPU by translating the guest instructions on-the-fly into instructions the host processor can understand. Each basic block of guest instructions is disassembled and translated into an intermediate representation called Tiny Code Generator (TCG). The TCG block is compiled into a block of host instructions, stored in a code cache, and executed. After execution of the basic block, QEMU repeats the process for the next block of guest instructions (or loads the already translated block from the cache). The whole process is called dynamic binary translation.</p> <p>Because the Android emulator is a fork of QEMU, it comes with all QEMU features, including monitoring, debugging, and tracing facilities. QEMU-specific parameters can be passed to the emulator with the <code>-qemu</code> command line flag. You can use QEMU's built-in tracing facilities to log executed instructions and virtual register values. Starting QEMU with the <code>-d</code> command line flag will cause it to dump the blocks of guest code, micro operations, or host instructions being executed. With the <code>-d_asm</code> flag, QEMU logs all basic blocks of guest code as they enter QEMU's translation function. The following command logs all translated blocks to a file:</p> <pre><code>emulator -show-kernel -avd Nexus_4_API_19 -snapshot default-boot -no-snapshot-save -qemu -d in_asm,cpu 2&gt;/tmp/qemu.log\n</code></pre> <p>Unfortunately, generating a complete guest instruction trace with QEMU is impossible because code blocks are written to the log only at the time they are translated, not when they're taken from the cache. For example, if a block is repeatedly executed in a loop, only the first iteration will be printed to the log. There's no way to disable TB caching in QEMU (besides hacking the source code).

In the validation function, there is a loop present at <code>0x00001784</code> which performs a XOR operation at offset <code>0x00001798</code>. The loop is more clearly visible in the graph view below.</p> <p></p> <p>XOR is a very commonly used technique to encrypt information where obfuscation is the goal rather than security. XOR should not be used for any serious encryption, as it can be cracked using frequency analysis. Therefore, the mere presence of XOR encryption in such a validation logic always requires special attention and analysis.</p> <p>Moving forward, at offset <code>0x000017dc</code>, the XOR decoded value obtained from above is being compared against the return value from a sub-function call at <code>0x000017e8</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Clearly this function is not complex, and can be analyzed manually, but still remains a cumbersome task. Especially while working on a big code base, time can be a major constraint, and it is desirable to automate such analysis. Dynamic symbolic execution is helpful in exactly those situations. In the above crackme, the symbolic execution engine can determine the constraints on each byte of the input string by mapping a path between the first instruction of the license check (at <code>0x00001760</code>) and the code that prints the \"Product activation passed\" message (at <code>0x00001840</code>).</p> <p></p> <p>The constraints obtained from the above steps are passed to a solver engine, which finds an input that satisfies them - a valid license key.</p> <p>You need to perform several steps to initialize Angr's symbolic execution engine:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Load the binary into a <code>Project</code>, which is the starting point for any kind of analysis in Angr.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pass the address from which the analysis should start. In this case, we will initialize the state with the first instruction of the serial validation function. This makes the problem significantly easier to solve because you avoid symbolically executing the Base32 implementation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pass the address of the code block that the analysis should reach. In this case, that's the offset <code>0x00001840</code>, where the code responsible for printing the \"Product activation passed\" message is located.</p> </li> <li> <p>Also, specify the addresses that the analysis should not reach. In this case, the code block that prints the \"Incorrect serial\" message at <code>0x00001854</code> is not interesting.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that the Angr loader will load the PIE executable with a base address of <code>0x400000</code>, which needs to be added to the offsets from iaito before passing it to Angr.</p> <p>The final solution script is presented below:</p> <pre><code>import angr # Version: 9.2.2\nimport base64\n\nload_options = {}\n\nb = angr.Project(\"./validate\", load_options = load_options)\n# The key validation function starts at 0x401760, so that's where we create the initial state.\n# This speeds things up a lot because we're bypassing the Base32-encoder.\n\noptions = {\n    angr.options.SYMBOL_FILL_UNCONSTRAINED_MEMORY,\n    angr.options.ZERO_FILL_UNCONSTRAINED_REGISTERS,\n}\n\nstate = b.factory.blank_state(addr=0x401760, add_options=options)\n\nsimgr = b.factory.simulation_manager(state)\nsimgr.explore(find=0x401840, avoid=0x401854)\n\n# 0x401840 = Product activation passed\n# 0x401854 = Incorrect serial\nfound = simgr.found[0]\n\n# Get the solution string from *(R11 - 0x20).\n\naddr = found.memory.load(found.regs.r11 - 0x20, 1, endness=\"Iend_LE\")\nconcrete_addr = found.solver.eval(addr)\nsolution = found.solver.eval(found.memory.load(concrete_addr,10), cast_to=bytes)\nprint(base64.b32encode(solution))\n</code></pre> <p>As discussed previously in the section \"Dynamic Binary Instrumentation\", the symbolic execution engine constructs a binary tree of the operations for the program input given and generates a mathematical equation for each possible path that might be taken. Internally, Angr explores all the paths between the two points specified by us, and passes the corresponding mathematical equations to the solver to return meaningful concrete results. We can access these solutions via <code>simulation_manager.found</code> list, which contains all the possible paths explored by Angr which satisfies our specified search criteria.</p> <p>Take a closer look at the latter part of the script where the final solution string is being retrieved. The address of the string is obtained from address <code>r11 - 0x20</code>. This may appear magical at first, but a careful analysis of the function at <code>0x00001760</code> holds the clue, as it determines if the given input string is a valid license key or not. In the disassembly above, you can see how the input string to the function (in register R0) is stored into a local stack variable <code>0x0000176c      str r0, [var_20h]</code>. Hence, we decided to use this value to retrieve the final solution in the script. Using <code>found.solver.eval</code> you can ask the solver questions like \"given the output of this sequence of operations (the current state in <code>found</code>), what must the input (at <code>addr</code>) have been?\".</p> <p>In ARMv7, R11 is called fp (function pointer), therefore <code>R11 - 0x20</code> is equivalent to <code>fp-0x20</code>: <code>var int32_t var_20h @ fp-0x20</code></p> <p>Next, the <code>endness</code> parameter in the script specifies that the data is stored in \"little-endian\" fashion, which is the case for almost all of the Android devices.</p> <p>Also, it may appear as if the script is simply reading the solution string from the memory of the script. However, it's reading it from the symbolic memory. Neither the string nor the pointer to the string actually exist. The solver ensures that the solution it provides is the same as if the program would be executed to that point.</p> <p>Running this script should return the following output:</p> <pre><code>$ python3 solve.py\nWARNING | ... | cle.loader | The main binary is a position-independent executable. It is being loaded with a base address of 0x400000.\n\nb'JACE6ACIARNAAIIA'\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can run the validate binary in your Android device to verify the solution as indicated here.</p> <p>You may obtain different solutions using the script, as there are multiple valid license keys possible.</p> <p>To conclude, learning symbolic execution might look a bit intimidating at first, as it requires deep understanding and extensive practice. However, the effort is justified considering the valuable time it can save in contrast to analyzing complex disassembled instructions manually. Typically you'd use hybrid techniques, as in the above example, where we performed manual analysis of the disassembled code to provide the correct criteria to the symbolic execution engine.

In addition, the fact that patching is unique to each application can also be considered a shortcoming, as this code cannot be easily reused.</p> <p>Using library injection you can develop reusable libraries and inject them to different applications, effectively making them behave differently without having to modify their original source code. This is known as DLL injection on Windows (broadly used to modify and bypass anti-cheat mechanisms in games), <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on Linux and <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> on macOS. On Android and iOS, a common example is using the Frida Gadget whenever Frida's so-called Injected mode of operation isn\u2019t suitable (i.e. you cannot run the Frida server on the target device).

A library can also be injected into a process using functionalities offered by the loader of the operating system. On Android, which is a Linux based OS, you can load an additional library by setting the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable.</p> <p>As the ld.so man page states, symbols loaded from the library passed using <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> always get precedence, i.e. they are searched first by the loader while resolving the symbols, effectively overriding the original ones. This feature is often used to inspect the input parameters of some commonly used libc functions such as <code>fopen</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>strcmp</code>, etc., specially in obfuscated programs, where understanding their behavior may be challenging. Therefore, having an insight on which files are being opened or which strings are being compared may be very valuable. The key idea here is \"function wrapping\", meaning that you cannot patch system calls such as libc's <code>fopen</code>, but you can override (wrap) it including custom code that will, for instance, print the input parameters for you and still call the original <code>fopen</code> remaining transparent to the caller.</p> <p>On Android, setting <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> is slightly different compared to other Linux distributions. If you recall from the \"Platform Overview\" section, every application in Android is forked from Zygote, which is started very early during the Android boot-up. Thus, setting <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on Zygote is not possible. As a workaround for this problem, Android supports the <code>setprop</code> (set property) functionality.

There is an <code>alertDialog.onClickListener</code> callback set in the <code>setButton</code> method call, which closes the application via <code>System.exit</code> after successful root detection.

Unlike the original, the new version of <code>a</code> just writes console output and doesn't exit the app. An alternative solution is to hook <code>onClick</code> method of the <code>OnClickListener</code> interface. You can overwrite the <code>onClick</code> method and prevent it from ending the application with the <code>System.exit</code> call.

To take advantage of these tools on a non-rooted device, the Android app must be repackaged with <code>frida-gadget.so</code> and re-signed. A detailed explanation of this process is in the section Dynamic Analysis on Non-Rooted Devices. To use these tools on a rooted phone, simply have frida-server installed and running.</p> <p>Note: When using these tools, you might get several memory access violation errors which can normally be ignored. These tools inject a Frida agent and try to dump all the mapped memory of the app regardless of the access permissions (read/write/execute). Therefore, when the injected Frida agent tries to read a region that's not readable, it'll return the corresponding memory access violation errors. Refer to previous section \"Memory Maps and Inspection\" for more details.</p> <p>With objection it is possible to dump all memory of the running process on the device by using the command <code>memory dump all</code>.</p> <pre><code>$ objection --gadget sg.vantagepoint.helloworldjni explore\n\nsg.vantagepoint.helloworldjni on (google: 8.1.0) [usb] # memory dump all /Users/foo/memory_Android/memory\n\nWill dump 719 rw- images, totalling 1.6 GiB\nDumping 1002.8 MiB from base: 0x14140000  [------------------------------------]    0%  00:11:03(session detach message) process-terminated\nDumping 8.0 MiB from base: 0x7fc753e000  [####################################]  100%\nMemory dumped to file: /Users/foo/memory_Android/memory\n</code></pre> <p>In this case there was an error, which is probably due to memory access violations as we already anticipated.

For example, it can determine whether geolocation data collected in an Android app is being transmitted to third-party domains.</p> <p>In taint analysis, data flows from a \"source\" to a \"sink\". A source is where sensitive information originates, and a sink is where this information is ultimately utilized. For instance, we can determine if the device ID retrieved by a <code>getDeviceId()</code> function is transmitted as a text message via another function <code>sendTextMessage()</code>. In this scenario, <code>getDeviceId()</code> is the source, and <code>sendTextMessage()</code> is the sink. If a direct path exists between them, it's called a leak.</p> <p>In large applications, manual information flow analysis can be very time consuming and inaccurate. Taint analysis automates this, with two main methods: static and dynamic. The former examines code without running it, offering broad coverage but potentially yielding false positives. In contrast, dynamic analysis observes real-time application execution, providing actual context but possibly overlooking untriggered issues. A thorough comparison of these techniques is beyond this section's scope.</p> <p>There are multiple tools which perform taint analysis on native code, including Triton and bincat. However, in this section, we'll primarily focus on Android Java code and utilize FlowDroid for the taint analysis. Another notable tool supporting taint analysis for Android apps is GDA.</p> <p>For our demonstration, we'll use the FlowDroid command line tool to perform taint analysis on the InsecureShop v1.0 application.</p> <p>The InsecureShop app accepts a username and password as input and stores them in the app's shared preferences. In our taint analysis, we're interested in how this stored username and password are used. In this context, the username and password are the sensitive information, and reading from shared preferences is the source. The sink in this analysis could be various operations, such as sending info over the network, transmitting info via an <code>Intent</code>, or storing info in an external file.</p> <p>To use FlowDroid, firstly, we need to provide an input list of potential sources and sinks to evaluate for. In our case, reading from shared preferences will be the source, while adding parameters to an <code>Intent</code> will be the sink. The configuration file will look as follows (we'll name it \"source_sink.txt\"):</p> <pre><code>&lt;android.content.SharedPreferences: java.lang.String getString(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)&gt; -&gt; _SOURCE_\n\n&lt;android.content.Intent: android.content.Intent putExtra(java.lang.String,java.lang.CharSequence)&gt; -&gt; _SINK_\n&lt;android.content.Intent: android.content.Intent putExtra(java.lang.String,char)&gt; -&gt; _SINK_\n&lt;android.content.Intent: android.content.Intent putExtra(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)&gt; -&gt; _SINK_\n</code></pre> <p>To invoke FlowDroid via the command line, use the following command:</p> <pre><code>java -jar soot-infoflow-cmd/target/soot-infoflow-cmd-jar-with-dependencies.jar \\\n    -a InsecureShop.apk \\\n    -p Android/Sdk/platforms \\\n    -s source_sink.txt\n\n\n[main] INFO soot.jimple.infoflow.android.SetupApplication$InPlaceInfoflow - The sink virtualinvoke r2.&lt;android.content.Intent: android.content.Intent putExtra(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)&gt;(\"password\", $r5) in method &lt;com.insecureshop.AboutUsActivity: void onSendData(android.view.View)&gt; was called with values from the following sources:\n\n[main] INFO soot.jimple.infoflow.android.SetupApplication$InPlaceInfoflow - - $r1 = interfaceinvoke $r2.&lt;android.content.SharedPreferences: java.lang.String getString(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)&gt;(\"password\", \"\") in method &lt;com.insecureshop.util.Prefs: java.lang.String getPassword()&gt;\n\n...\n\n[main] INFO soot.jimple.infoflow.android.SetupApplication$InPlaceInfoflow - The sink virtualinvoke r2.&lt;android.content.Intent: android.content.Intent putExtra(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)&gt;(\"username\", $r4) in method &lt;com.insecureshop.AboutUsActivity: void onSendData(android.view.View)&gt; was called with values from the following sources:\n\n[main] INFO soot.jimple.infoflow.android.SetupApplication$InPlaceInfoflow - - $r1 = interfaceinvoke $r2.&lt;android.content.SharedPreferences: java.lang.String getString(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)&gt;(\"username\", \"\") in method &lt;com.insecureshop.util.Prefs: java.lang.String getUsername()&gt;\n\n...\n\n[main] INFO soot.jimple.infoflow.android.SetupApplication - Found 2 leaks\n</code></pre> <p>The output also uses the jimple intermediate representation and reveals two leaks in the application, each corresponding to the username and password. Given that the InsecureShop app is open-source, we can refer to its source code to validate the findings, as shown below:</p> <pre><code>// file: AboutActivity.kt\n\nfun onSendData(view: View) {\n        val userName = Prefs.username!!\n        val password = Prefs.password!!\n\n        val intent = Intent(\"com.insecureshop.action.BROADCAST\")\n        intent.putExtra(\"username\", userName)\n        intent.putExtra(\"password\", password)\n        sendBroadcast(intent)\n\n        textView.text = \"InsecureShop is an intentionally designed vulnerable android app built in Kotlin.\"\n\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Taint analysis is especially beneficial for automating data flow analysis in intricate applications. However, given the complexity of some apps, the accuracy of such tools can vary. Thus, it's essential for reviewers to find a balance between the accuracy of tools and the time spent on manual analysis.</p>","tags":["android"]},{"location":"MASTG/techniques/android/MASTG-TECH-0109/","title":"MASTG-TECH-0109: Intercepting Flutter HTTPS Traffic","text":"<p>Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google.

For basic API monitoring, you can get away with not knowing all the details of how Substrate or Frida work - you can simply use existing API monitoring tools.</p> <p>On iOS, collecting basic information about a running process or an application can be slightly more challenging than compared to Android.

Thus, any information about a target process can be obtained on a rooted device by parsing these text files. In contrast, on iOS there is no procfs equivalent present.

Other strings might be helpful in some cases, such as those containing symbols (function names, class names, etc.) and we'll be using them when performing static analysis to check if some specific function is being used.</p> <p></p> <p>If we continue our careful analysis, we can spot the string, \"Verification Failed\", which is used for the pop-up when a wrong input is given. If you follow the cross-references (Xrefs) of this string, you will reach <code>buttonClick</code> function of the <code>ViewController</code> class. We will look into the <code>buttonClick</code> function later in this section. When further checking the other strings in the application, only a few of them look a likely candidate for a hidden flag. You can try them and verify as well.</p> <p></p> <p>Moving forward, we have two paths to take. Either we can start analyzing the <code>buttonClick</code> function identified in the above step, or start analyzing the application from the various entry points. In real world situation, most times you will be taking the first path, but from a learning perspective, in this section we will take the latter path.</p> <p>An iOS application calls different predefined functions provided by the iOS runtime depending on its the state within the application life cycle. These functions are known as the entry points of the app. For example:</p> <ul> <li><code>[AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]</code> is called when the application is started for the first time.</li> <li><code>[AppDelegate applicationDidBecomeActive:]</code> is called when the application is moving from inactive to active state.</li> </ul> <p>Many applications execute critical code in these sections and therefore they're normally a good starting point in order to follow the code systematically.</p> <p>Once we're done with the analysis of all the functions in the <code>AppDelegate</code> class, we can conclude that there is no relevant code present. The lack of any code in the above functions raises the question - from where is the application's initialization code being called?</p> <p>Luckily the current application has a small code base, and we can find another <code>ViewController</code> class in the Symbol Tree view. In this class, function <code>viewDidLoad</code> function looks interesting. If you check the documentation of <code>viewDidLoad</code>, you can see that it can also be used to perform additional initialization on views.</p> <p></p> <p>If we check the decompilation of this function, there are a few interesting things going on. For instance, there is a call to a native function at line 31 and a label is initialized with a <code>setHidden</code> flag set to 1 in lines 27-29. You can keep a note of these observations and continue exploring the other functions in this class. For brevity, exploring the other parts of the function is left as an exercise for the readers.</p> <p>In our first step, we observed that the application verifies the input string only when the UI button is pressed. Thus, analyzing the <code>buttonClick</code> function is an obvious target. As earlier mentioned, this function also contains the string we see in the pop-ups. At line 29 a decision is being made, which is based on the result of <code>isEqualString</code> (output saved in <code>uVar1</code> at line 23). The input for the comparison is coming from the text input field (from the user) and the value of the <code>label</code>. Therefore, we can assume that the hidden flag is stored in that label.</p> <p></p> <p>Now we have followed the complete flow and have all the information about the application flow. We also concluded that the hidden flag is present in a text label and in order to determine the value of the label, we need to revisit <code>viewDidLoad</code> function, and understand what is happening in the native function identified. Analysis of the native function is discussed in \"Reviewing Disassembled Native Code\".</p>","tags":["ios"]},{"location":"MASTG/techniques/ios/MASTG-TECH-0077/","title":"MASTG-TECH-0077: Reviewing Disassembled Native Code","text":"<p>Analyzing disassembled native code requires a good understanding of the calling conventions and instructions used by the underlying platform. In this section we are looking in ARM64 disassembly of the native code. A good starting point to learn about ARM architecture is available at Introduction to ARM Assembly Basics by Azeria Labs Tutorials. This is a quick summary of the things that we will be using in this section:</p> <ul> <li>In ARM64, a register is of 64 bit in size and referred to as Xn, where n is a number from 0 to 31. If the lower (LSB) 32 bits of the register are used then it's referred to as Wn.</li> <li>The input parameters to a function are passed in the X0-X7 registers.</li> <li>The return value of the function is passed via the X0 register.</li> <li>Load (LDR) and store (STR) instructions are used to read or write to memory from/to a register.</li> <li>B, BL, BLX are branch instructions used for calling a function.</li> </ul> <p>As mentioned above as well, Objective-C code is also compiled to native binary code, but analyzing C/C++ native can be more challenging. In case of Objective-C there are various symbols (especially function names) present, which eases the understanding of the code. In the above section we've learned that the presence of function names like <code>setText</code>, <code>isEqualStrings</code> can help us in quickly understanding the semantics of the code. In case of C/C++ native code, if all the binaries are stripped, there can be very few or no symbols present to assist us into analyzing it.</p> <p>Decompilers can help us in analyzing native code, but they should be used with caution. Modern decompilers are very sophisticated and among many techniques used by them to decompile code, a few of them are heuristics based. Heuristics based techniques might not always give correct results, one such case being, determining the number of input parameters for a given native function. Having knowledge of analyzing disassembled code, assisted with decompilers can make analyzing native code less error prone.</p> <p>We will be analyzing the native function identified in <code>viewDidLoad</code> function in the previous section. The function is located at offset 0x1000080d4. The return value of this function used in the <code>setText</code> function call for the label. This text is used to compare against the user input. Thus, we can be sure that this function will be returning a string or equivalent.</p> <p></p> <p>The first thing we can see in the disassembly of the function is that there is no input to the function. The registers X0-X7 are not read throughout the function. Also, there are multiple calls to other functions like the ones at 0x100008158, 0x10000dbf0 etc.</p> <p>The instructions corresponding to one such function calls can be seen below. The branch instruction <code>bl</code> is used to call the function at 0x100008158.</p> <pre><code>1000080f0 1a 00 00 94     bl         FUN_100008158\n1000080f4 60 02 00 39     strb       w0,[x19]=&gt;DAT_10000dbf0\n</code></pre> <p>The return value from the function (found in W0), is stored to the address in register X19 (<code>strb</code> stores a byte to the address in register). We can see the same pattern for other function calls, the returned value is stored in X19 register and each time the offset is one more than the previous function call. This behavior can be associated with populating each index of a string array at a time. Each return value is been written to an index of this string array. There are 11 such calls, and from the current evidence we can make an intelligent guess that length of the hidden flag is 11. Towards the end of the disassembly, the function returns with the address to this string array.</p> <pre><code>100008148 e0 03 13 aa     mov        x0=&gt;DAT_10000dbf0,x19\n</code></pre> <p>To determine the value of the hidden flag we need to know the return value of each of the subsequent function calls identified above. When analyzing the function 0x100006fb4, we can observe that this function is much bigger and more complex than the previous one we analyzed. Function graphs can be very helpful when analyzing complex functions, as it helps into better understanding the control flow of the function. Function graphs can be obtained in Ghidra by clicking the Display function graph icon in the sub-menu.</p> <p></p> <p>Manually analyzing all the native functions completely will be time consuming and might not be the wisest approach. In such a scenario using a dynamic analysis approach is highly recommended. For instance, by using the techniques like hooking or simply debugging the application, we can easily determine the returned values. Normally it's a good idea to use a dynamic analysis approach and then fallback to manually analyzing the functions in a feedback loop. This way you can benefit from both approaches at the same time while saving time and reducing effort.

In other words, this represents Apple explicitly allowing your app to run for certain reasons, such as debugging on selected devices (development profile). The provisioning profile also includes the entitlements granted to your app. The certificate contains the private key you'll use to sign.</p> <p>Depending on whether you're registered as an iOS developer, you can obtain a certificate and provisioning profile in one of the following ways:</p> <p>With an iOS developer account:</p> <p>If you've developed and deployed iOS apps with Xcode before, you already have your own code-signing certificate installed. Use the <code>security</code> command (macOS only) to list your signing identities:</p> <pre><code>$ security find-identity -v\n 1) 61FA3547E0AF42A11E233F6A2B255E6B6AF262CE \"iPhone Distribution: Company Name Ltd.\"\n 2) 8004380F331DCA22CC1B47FB1A805890AE41C938 \"iPhone Developer: Bernhard M\u00fcller (RV852WND79)\"\n</code></pre> <p>Log into the Apple Developer portal to issue a new App ID, then issue and download the profile. An App ID is a two-part string: a Team ID supplied by Apple and a bundle ID search string that you can set to an arbitrary value, such as <code>com.example.myapp</code>. Note that you can use a single App ID to re-sign multiple apps. Make sure you create a development profile and not a distribution profile so that you can debug the app.</p> <p>In the examples below, I use my signing identity, which is associated with my company's development team. I created the App ID \"sg.vp.repackaged\" and the provisioning profile \"AwesomeRepackaging\" for these examples. I ended up with the file <code>AwesomeRepackaging.mobileprovision</code>-replace this with your own filename in the shell commands below.</p> <p>With a Regular Apple ID:</p> <p>Apple will issue a free development provisioning profile even if you're not a paying developer. You can obtain the profile via Xcode and your regular Apple account: simply create an empty iOS project and extract <code>embedded.mobileprovision</code> from the app container, which is in the Xcode subdirectory of your home directory: <code>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/&lt;ProjectName&gt;/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/&lt;ProjectName&gt;.app/</code>. The NCC blog post \"iOS instrumentation without jailbreak\" explains this process in great detail.</p> <p>Once you've obtained the provisioning profile, you can check its contents with the <code>security</code> command. You'll find the entitlements granted to the app in the profile, along with the allowed certificates and devices. You'll need these for code-signing, so extract them to a separate plist file as shown below. Have a look at the file contents to make sure everything is as expected.</p> <pre><code>$ security cms -D -i AwesomeRepackaging.mobileprovision &gt; profile.plist\n$ /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c 'Print :Entitlements' profile.plist &gt; entitlements.plist\n$ cat entitlements.plist\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;plist version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n&lt;dict&gt;\n &lt;key&gt;application-identifier&lt;/key&gt;\n &lt;string&gt;LRUD9L355Y.sg.vantagepoint.repackage&lt;/string&gt;\n &lt;key&gt;com.apple.developer.team-identifier&lt;/key&gt;\n &lt;string&gt;LRUD9L355Y&lt;/string&gt;\n &lt;key&gt;get-task-allow&lt;/key&gt;\n &lt;true/&gt;\n &lt;key&gt;keychain-access-groups&lt;/key&gt;\n &lt;array&gt;\n   &lt;string&gt;LRUD9L355Y.*&lt;/string&gt;\n &lt;/array&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Note the application identifier, which is a combination of the Team ID (LRUD9L355Y) and Bundle ID (sg.vantagepoint.repackage).

In this section we will use this information and learn how to debug a 3rd party release application. We will continue using the UnCrackable App for iOS Level 1 and solve it using a debugger.</p> <p>In contrast to a debug build, the code compiled for a release build is optimized to achieve maximum performance and minimum binary build size. As a general best practice, most of the debug symbols are stripped for a release build, adding a layer of complexity when reverse engineering and debugging the binaries.</p> <p>Due to the absence of the debug symbols, symbol names are missing from the backtrace outputs and setting breakpoints by simply using function names is not possible. Fortunately, debuggers also support setting breakpoints directly on memory addresses. Further in this section we will learn how to do so and eventually solve the crackme challenge.</p> <p>Some groundwork is needed before setting a breakpoint using memory addresses. It requires determining two offsets:</p> <ol> <li>Breakpoint offset: The address offset of the code where we want to set a breakpoint. This address is obtained by performing static analysis of the code in a disassembler like Ghidra.</li> <li>ASLR shift offset: The ASLR shift offset for the current process. Since ASLR offset is randomly generated on every new instance of an application, this has to be obtained for every debugging session individually. This is determined using the debugger itself.</li> </ol> <p>iOS is a modern operating system with multiple techniques implemented to mitigate code execution attacks, one such technique being Address Space Randomization Layout (ASLR). On every new execution of an application, a random ASLR shift offset is generated, and various process' data structures are shifted by this offset.</p> <p>The final breakpoint address to be used in the debugger is the sum of the above two addresses (Breakpoint offset + ASLR shift offset). This approach assumes that the image base address (discussed shortly) used by the disassembler and iOS is the same, which is true most of the time.</p> <p>When a binary is opened in a disassembler like Ghidra, it loads a binary by emulating the respective operating system's loader. The address at which the binary is loaded is called image base address. All the code and symbols inside this binary can be addressed using a constant address offset from this image base address. In Ghidra, the image base address can be obtained by determining the address of the start of a Mach-O file. In this case, it is 0x100000000.</p> <p></p> <p>From our previous analysis of the UnCrackable App for iOS Level 1 in \"Manual (Reversed) Code Review\" section, the value of the hidden string is stored in a label with the <code>hidden</code> flag set. In the disassembly, the text value of this label is stored in register <code>X21</code>, stored via <code>mov</code> from <code>X0</code>, at offset 0x100004520. This is our breakpoint offset.</p> <p></p> <p>For the second address, we need to determine the ASLR shift offset for a given process. The ASLR offset can be determined by using the LLDB command <code>image list -o -f</code>. The output is shown in the screenshot below.</p> <p></p> <p>In the output, the first column contains the sequence number of the image ([X]), the second column contains the randomly generated ASLR offset, while 3rd column contains the full path of the image and towards the end, content in the bracket shows the image base address after adding ASLR offset to the original image base address (0x100000000 + 0x70000 = 0x100070000). You will notice the image base address of 0x100000000 is same as in Ghidra. Now, to obtain the effective memory address for a code location we only need to add ASLR offset to the address identified in Ghidra. The effective address to set the breakpoint will be 0x100004520 + 0x70000 = 0x100074520.

Unicorn provides the basic infrastructure needed to execute processor instructions. In this section we will use Unicorn's Python bindings to solve the UnCrackable App for iOS Level 1 challenge.</p> <p>To use Unicorn's full power, we would need to implement all the necessary infrastructure which generally is readily available from the operating system, e.g. binary loader, linker and other dependencies or use another higher level frameworks such as Qiling which leverages Unicorn to emulate CPU instructions, but understands the OS context. However, this is superfluous for this very localized challenge where only executing a small part of the binary will suffice.</p> <p>While performing manual analysis in \"Reviewing Disassembled Native Code\" section, we determined that the function at address 0x1000080d4 is responsible for dynamically generating the secret string. As we're about to see, all the necessary code is pretty much self-contained in the binary, making this a perfect scenario to use a CPU emulator like Unicorn.</p> <p></p> <p>If we analyze that function and the subsequent function calls, we will observe that there is no hard dependency on any external library and neither it's performing any system calls. The only access external to the functions occurs for instance at address 0x1000080f4, where a value is being stored to address 0x10000dbf0, which maps to the <code>__data</code> section.</p> <p>Therefore, in order to correctly emulate this section of the code, apart from the <code>__text</code> section (which contains the instructions) we also need to load the <code>__data</code> section.</p> <p>To solve the challenge using Unicorn we will perform the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Get the ARM64 version of the binary by running <code>lipo -thin arm64 &lt;app_binary&gt; -output uncrackable.arm64</code> (ARMv7 can be used as well).</li> <li>Extract the <code>__text</code> and <code>__data</code> section from the binary.</li> <li>Create and map the memory to be used as stack memory.</li> <li>Create memory and load the <code>__text</code> and <code>__data</code> section.</li> <li>Execute the binary by providing the start and end address.</li> <li>Finally, dump the return value from the function, which in this case is our secret string.</li> </ul> <p>To extract the content of <code>__text</code> and <code>__data</code> section from the Mach-O binary we will use LIEF, which provides a convenient abstraction to manipulate multiple executable file formats. Before loading these sections to memory, we need to determine their base addresses, e.g. by using Ghidra, Radare2 or IDA Pro.</p> <p></p> <p>From the above table, we will use the base address 0x10000432c for <code>__text</code> and 0x10000d3e8 for <code>__data</code> section to load them at in the memory.</p> <p>While allocating memory for Unicorn, the memory addresses should be 4k page aligned and also the allocated size should be a multiple of 1024.</p> <p>The following script emulates the function at 0x1000080d4 and dumps the secret string:</p> <pre><code>import lief\nfrom unicorn import *\nfrom unicorn.arm64_const import *\n\n# --- Extract __text and __data section content from the binary ---\nbinary = lief.parse(\"uncrackable.arm64\")\ntext_section = binary.get_section(\"__text\")\ntext_content = text_section.content\n\ndata_section = binary.get_section(\"__data\")\ndata_content = data_section.content\n\n# --- Setup Unicorn for ARM64 execution ---\narch = \"arm64le\"\nemu = Uc(UC_ARCH_ARM64, UC_MODE_ARM)\n\n# --- Create Stack memory ---\naddr = 0x40000000\nsize = 1024*1024\nemu.mem_map(addr, size)\nemu.reg_write(UC_ARM64_REG_SP, addr + size - 1)\n\n# --- Load text section --\nbase_addr = 0x100000000\ntmp_len = 1024*1024\ntext_section_load_addr = 0x10000432c\nemu.mem_map(base_addr, tmp_len)\nemu.mem_write(text_section_load_addr, bytes(text_content))\n\n# --- Load data section ---\ndata_section_load_addr = 0x10000d3e8\nemu.mem_write(data_section_load_addr, bytes(data_content))\n\n# --- Hack for stack_chk_guard ---\n# without this will throw invalid memory read at 0x0\nemu.mem_map(0x0, 1024)\nemu.mem_write(0x0, b\"00\")\n\n\n# --- Execute from 0x1000080d4 to 0x100008154 ---\nemu.emu_start(0x1000080d4, 0x100008154)\nret_value = emu.reg_read(UC_ARM64_REG_X0)\n\n# --- Dump return value ---\nprint(emu.mem_read(ret_value, 11))\n</code></pre> <p>You may notice that there is an additional memory allocation at address 0x0, this is a simple hack around <code>stack_chk_guard</code> check. Without this, there will be a invalid memory read error and binary cannot be executed. With this hack, the program will access the value at 0x0 and use it for the <code>stack_chk_guard</code> check.</p> <p>To summarize, using Unicorn do require some additional setup before executing the binary, but once done, this tool can help to provide deep insights into the binary. It provides the flexibility to execute the full binary or a limited part of it. Unicorn also exposes APIs to attach hooks to the execution. Using these hooks you can observe the state of the program at any point during the execution or even manipulate the register or variable values and forcefully explore other execution branches in a program. Another advantage when running a binary in Unicorn is that you don't need to worry about various checks like root/jailbreak detection or debugger detection etc.</p>","tags":["ios"]},{"location":"MASTG/techniques/ios/MASTG-TECH-0089/","title":"MASTG-TECH-0089: Symbolic Execution","text":"<p>You can find an introduction to binary analysis using binary analysis frameworks in \"Dynamic Analysis on Android\".

In the previous section, you saw that the main binary is located between <code>0x0000000100b7c000</code> and <code>0x0000000100e97000</code>.</p> <p>Now, for this second example, you can search for something that's not in the app binary nor in any loaded library, typically user input. Open the iGoat-Swift app and navigate in the menu to Authentication -&gt; Remote Authentication -&gt; Start. There you'll find a password field that you can overwrite. Write the string \"owasp-mstg\" but do not click on Login just yet.

Note that searching for the wide versions of strings is sometimes the only way to find them as you'll see in the following section.</p> <p>In-memory search can be very useful to quickly know if certain data is located in the main app binary, inside a shared library or in another region. You may also use it to test the behavior of the app regarding how the data is kept in memory. For instance, you could continue the previous example, this time clicking on Login and searching again for occurrences of the data. Also, you may check if you still can find those strings in memory after the login is completed to verify if this sensitive data is wiped from memory after its use.</p>","tags":["ios"]},{"location":"MASTG/techniques/ios/MASTG-TECH-0096/#memory-dump","title":"Memory Dump","text":"<p>You can dump the app's process memory with objection and Fridump.

It is used for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses Dart, which is not proxy-aware and uses its own certificate store. The application doesn't use the proxy configuration of the system and sends the data directly to the server. Connections are verified against built-in certificates, so any certificates installed on the system are simply ignored. Due to this, it is not possible to intercept HTTPS requests as the certificate of the proxy will never be trusted.</p> <p>In order to intercept Flutter HTTPS traffic, we need to deal with two problems:</p> <ul> <li>Make sure the traffic is sent to the proxy.</li> <li>Disable the TLS verification of any HTTPS connection.</li> </ul> <p>There are generally two approaches to this: reFlutter and Frida.</p> <ul> <li>reFlutter: This tool creates a modified version of the Flutter module which is then repackaged into the IPA. It configures the internal libraries to use a specified proxy and disable the TLS verification.</li> <li>Frida: The disable-flutter-tls.js script can dynamically remove the TLS verification without the need for repackaging.

Pay special attention to deep links being used to transmit data (which is controlled externally by the user or any other app).</p> <p>First, obtain the name of the Activity from the Android Manifest <code>&lt;activity&gt;</code> element which defines the target <code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;</code> and search for usage of <code>getIntent</code> and <code>getData</code>. This general approach of locating these methods can be used across most applications when performing reverse engineering and is key when trying to understand how the application uses deep links and handles any externally provided input data and if it could be subject to any kind of abuse.</p> <p>The following example is a snippet from an exemplary Kotlin app decompiled with jadx. From the static analysis we know that it supports the deep link <code>deeplinkdemo://load.html/</code> as part of <code>com.mstg.deeplinkdemo.WebViewActivity</code>.</p> <pre><code>// snippet edited for simplicity\npublic final class WebViewActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    private ActivityWebViewBinding binding;\n\n    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        Uri data = getIntent().getData();\n        String html = data == null ? null : data.getQueryParameter(\"html\");\n        Uri data2 = getIntent().getData();\n        String deeplink_url = data2 == null ? null : data2.getQueryParameter(\"url\");\n        View findViewById = findViewById(R.id.webView);\n        if (findViewById != null) {\n            WebView wv = (WebView) findViewById;\n            wv.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);\n            if (deeplink_url != null) {\n                wv.loadUrl(deeplink_url);\n            ...\n</code></pre> <p>You can simply follow the <code>deeplink_url</code> String variable and see the result from the <code>wv.loadUrl</code> call. This means the attacker has full control of the URL being loaded to the WebView (as shown above has JavaScript enabled.</p> <p>The same WebView might be also rendering an attacker controlled parameter. In that case, the following deep link payload would trigger Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within the context of the WebView:</p> <pre><code>deeplinkdemo://load.html?attacker_controlled=&lt;svg onload=alert(1)&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>But there are many other possibilities.

You will first start a Frida hook and then begin invoking the deep links.</p> <p>The following example assumes a target app that accepts this deep link: <code>deeplinkdemo://load.html</code>. However, we don't know the corresponding handler method yet, nor the parameters it potentially accepts.</p> <p>[Step 1] Frida Hooking:</p> <p>You can use the script \"Android Deep Link Observer\" from Frida CodeShare to monitor all invoked deep links triggering a call to <code>Intent.getData</code>. You can also use the script as a base to include your own modifications depending on the use case at hand. In this case we included the stack trace in the script since we are interested in the method which calls <code>Intent.getData</code>.</p> <p>[Step 2] Invoking Deep Links:</p> <p>Now you can invoke any of the deep links using adb and the Activity Manager (am) which will send intents within the Android device. For example:</p> <pre><code>adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d \"deeplinkdemo://load.html/?message=ok#part1\"\n\nStarting: Intent { act=android.intent.action.VIEW dat=deeplinkdemo://load.html/?message=ok }\nStatus: ok\nLaunchState: WARM\nActivity: com.mstg.deeplinkdemo/.WebViewActivity\nTotalTime: 210\nWaitTime: 217\nComplete\n</code></pre> <p>This might trigger the disambiguation dialog when using the \"http/https\" schema or if other installed apps support the same custom URL schema. You can include the package name to make it an explicit intent.</p> <p>This invocation will log the following:</p> <pre><code>[*] Intent.getData() was called\n[*] Activity: com.mstg.deeplinkdemo.WebViewActivity\n[*] Action: android.intent.action.VIEW\n\n[*] Data\n- Scheme: deeplinkdemo://\n- Host: /load.html\n- Params: message=ok\n- Fragment: part1\n\n[*] Stacktrace:\n\nandroid.content.Intent.getData(Intent.java)\ncom.mstg.deeplinkdemo.WebViewActivity.onCreate(WebViewActivity.kt)\nandroid.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java)\n...\ncom.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java)\n</code></pre> <p>In this case we've crafted the deep link including arbitrary parameters (<code>?message=ok</code>) and fragment (<code>#part1</code>).

There are two common ways to designate a component as exported. The obvious one is setting the export tag to true <code>android:exported=\"true\"</code>. The second way involves defining an <code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;</code> within the component element (<code>&lt;activity&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;service&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;receiver&gt;</code>). When this is done, the export tag is automatically set to \"true\". To prevent all other Android apps from interacting with the IPC component element, be sure that the <code>android:exported=\"true\"</code> value and an <code>&lt;intent-filter&gt;</code> aren't in their <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> files unless this is necessary.</p> <p>Remember that using the permission tag (<code>android:permission</code>) will also limit other applications' access to a component. If your IPC is intended to be accessible to other applications, you can apply a security policy with the <code>&lt;permission&gt;</code> element and set a proper <code>android:protectionLevel</code>.

However if it's set to false, it will only clear the RAM cache. Check the app for usage of the <code>clearCache</code> method and verify its input parameter.

You may miss executing critical scenarios. In addition, overlooking data during analysis is probable unless you know the data's footprint (either the exact value or the data format).

Nullifying these structures will be ineffective: the garbage collector may collect them, but they may remain on the heap after garbage collection. Nevertheless, you should ask for garbage collection after every critical operation (e.g., encryption, parsing server responses that contain sensitive information). When copies of the information have not been properly cleaned (as explained below), your request will help reduce the length of time for which these copies are available in memory.</p> <p>To properly clean sensitive information from memory, store it in primitive data types, such as byte-arrays (<code>byte[]</code>) and char-arrays (<code>char[]</code>). You should avoid storing the information in mutable non-primitive data types.</p> <p>Make sure to overwrite the content of the critical object once the object is no longer needed. Overwriting the content with zeroes is one simple and very popular method:</p> <p>Example in Java:</p> <pre><code>byte[] secret = null;\ntry{\n    //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies\n} finally {\n    if (null != secret) {\n        Arrays.fill(secret, (byte) 0);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Example in Kotlin:</p> <pre><code>val secret: ByteArray? = null\ntry {\n     //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies\n} finally {\n    if (null != secret) {\n        Arrays.fill(secret, 0.toByte())\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This doesn't, however, guarantee that the content will be overwritten at runtime. To optimize the bytecode, the compiler will analyze and decide not to overwrite data because it will not be used afterwards (i.e., it is an unnecessary operation). Even if the code is in the compiled DEX, the optimization may occur during the just-in-time or ahead-of-time compilation in the VM.</p> <p>There is no silver bullet for this problem because different solutions have different consequences. For example, you may perform additional calculations (e.g., XOR the data into a dummy buffer), but you'll have no way to know the extent of the compiler's optimization analysis. On the other hand, using the overwritten data outside the compiler's scope (e.g., serializing it in a temp file) guarantees that it will be overwritten but obviously impacts performance and maintenance.</p> <p>Then, using <code>Arrays.fill</code> to overwrite the data is a bad idea because the method is an obvious hooking target (see \"Method Hooking\" for more details).</p> <p>The final issue with the above example is that the content was overwritten with zeroes only. You should try to overwrite critical objects with random data or content from non-critical objects. This will make it really difficult to construct scanners that can identify sensitive data on the basis of its management.</p> <p>Below is an improved version of the previous example:</p> <p>Example in Java:</p> <pre><code>byte[] nonSecret = somePublicString.getBytes(\"ISO-8859-1\");\nbyte[] secret = null;\ntry{\n    //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies\n} finally {\n    if (null != secret) {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; secret.length; i++) {\n            secret[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.length];\n        }\n\n        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(\"/dev/null\");\n        out.write(secret);\n        out.flush();\n        out.close();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Example in Kotlin:</p> <pre><code>val nonSecret: ByteArray = somePublicString.getBytes(\"ISO-8859-1\")\nval secret: ByteArray? = null\ntry {\n     //get or generate the secret, do work with it, make sure you make no local copies\n} finally {\n    if (null != secret) {\n        for (i in secret.indices) {\n            secret[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.size]\n        }\n\n        val out = FileOutputStream(\"/dev/null\")\n        out.write(secret)\n        out.flush()\n        out.close()\n        }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For more information, take a look at Securely Storing Sensitive Data in RAM.</p> <p>In the \"Static Analysis\" section, we mentioned the proper way to handle cryptographic keys when you are using <code>AndroidKeyStore</code> or <code>SecretKey</code>.</p> <p>For a better implementation of <code>SecretKey</code>, look at the <code>SecureSecretKey</code> class below. Although the implementation is probably missing some boilerplate code that would make the class compatible with <code>SecretKey</code>, it addresses the main security concerns:</p> <ul> <li>No cross-context handling of sensitive data. Each copy of the key can be cleared from within the scope in which it was created.</li> <li>The local copy is cleared according to the recommendations given above.</li> </ul> <p>Example in Java:</p> <pre><code>  public class SecureSecretKey implements javax.crypto.SecretKey, Destroyable {\n      private byte[] key;\n      private final String algorithm;\n\n      /** Constructs SecureSecretKey instance out of a copy of the provided key bytes.\n        * The caller is responsible of clearing the key array provided as input.\n        * The internal copy of the key can be cleared by calling the destroy() method.\n        */\n      public SecureSecretKey(final byte[] key, final String algorithm) {\n          this.key = key.clone();\n          this.algorithm = algorithm;\n      }\n\n      public String getAlgorithm() {\n          return this.algorithm;\n      }\n\n      public String getFormat() {\n          return \"RAW\";\n      }\n\n      /** Returns a copy of the key.\n        * Make sure to clear the returned byte array when no longer needed.\n        */\n      public byte[] getEncoded() {\n          if(null == key){\n              throw new NullPointerException();\n          }\n\n          return key.clone();\n      }\n\n      /** Overwrites the key with dummy data to ensure this copy is no longer present in memory.*/\n      public void destroy() {\n          if (isDestroyed()) {\n              return;\n          }\n\n          byte[] nonSecret = new String(\"RuntimeException\").getBytes(\"ISO-8859-1\");\n          for (int i = 0; i &lt; key.length; i++) {\n            key[i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.length];\n          }\n\n          FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(\"/dev/null\");\n          out.write(key);\n          out.flush();\n          out.close();\n\n          this.key = null;\n          System.gc();\n      }\n\n      public boolean isDestroyed() {\n          return key == null;\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>Example in Kotlin:</p> <pre><code>class SecureSecretKey(key: ByteArray, algorithm: String) : SecretKey, Destroyable {\n    private var key: ByteArray?\n    private val algorithm: String\n    override fun getAlgorithm(): String {\n        return algorithm\n    }\n\n    override fun getFormat(): String {\n        return \"RAW\"\n    }\n\n    /** Returns a copy of the key.\n     * Make sure to clear the returned byte array when no longer needed.\n     */\n    override fun getEncoded(): ByteArray {\n        if (null == key) {\n            throw NullPointerException()\n        }\n        return key!!.clone()\n    }\n\n    /** Overwrites the key with dummy data to ensure this copy is no longer present in memory. */\n    override fun destroy() {\n        if (isDestroyed) {\n            return\n        }\n        val nonSecret: ByteArray = String(\"RuntimeException\").toByteArray(charset(\"ISO-8859-1\"))\n        for (i in key!!.indices) {\n            key!![i] = nonSecret[i % nonSecret.size]\n        }\n        val out = FileOutputStream(\"/dev/null\")\n        out.write(key)\n        out.flush()\n        out.close()\n        key = null\n        System.gc()\n    }\n\n    override fun isDestroyed(): Boolean {\n        return key == null\n    }\n\n    /** Constructs SecureSecretKey instance out of a copy of the provided key bytes.\n     * The caller is responsible of clearing the key array provided as input.\n     * The internal copy of the key can be cleared by calling the destroy() method.\n     */\n    init {\n        this.key = key.clone()\n        this.algorithm = algorithm\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Secure user-provided data is the final secure information type usually found in memory. This is often managed by implementing a custom input method, for which you should follow the recommendations given here. However, Android allows information to be partially erased from <code>EditText</code> buffers via a custom <code>Editable.Factory</code>.</p> <pre><code>EditText editText = ...; //  point your variable to your EditText instance\nEditText.setEditableFactory(new Editable.Factory() {\n  public Editable newEditable(CharSequence source) {\n  ... // return a new instance of a secure implementation of Editable.\n  }\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Refer to the <code>SecureSecretKey</code> example above for an example <code>Editable</code> implementation. Note that you will be able to securely handle all copies made by <code>editText.getText</code> if you provide your factory. You can also try to overwrite the internal <code>EditText</code> buffer by calling <code>editText.setText</code>, but there is no guarantee that the buffer will not have been copied already. If you choose to rely on the default input method and <code>EditText</code>, you will have no control over the keyboard or other components that are used. Therefore, you should use this approach for semi-confidential information only.</p> <p>In all cases, make sure that sensitive data in memory is cleared when a user signs out of the application. Finally, make sure that highly sensitive information is cleared out the moment an Activity or Fragment's <code>onPause</code> event is triggered.</p> <p>Note that this might mean that a user has to re-authenticate every time the application resumes.</p>","tags":["android","MASVS-STORAGE-2","MSTG-STORAGE-10"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0011/#dynamic-analysis","title":"Dynamic Analysis","text":"<p>Static analysis will help you identify potential problems, but it can't provide statistics about how long data has been exposed in memory, nor can it help you identify problems in closed-source dependencies.

They are on the Android Monitor tab. To dump memory, select the device and app you want to analyze and click Dump Java Heap. This will create a .hprof file in the captures directory, which is on the app's project path.</p> <p></p> <p>To navigate through class instances that were saved in the memory dump, select the Package Tree View in the tab showing the .hprof file.</p> <p></p> <p>For more advanced analysis of the memory dump, use the Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT). It is available as an Eclipse plugin and as a standalone application.</p> <p>To analyze the dump in MAT, use the hprof-conv platform tool, which comes with the Android SDK.</p> <pre><code>./hprof-conv memory.hprof memory-mat.hprof\n</code></pre> <p>MAT provides several tools for analyzing the memory dump. For example, the Histogram provides an estimate of the number of objects that have been captured from a given type, and the Thread Overview shows processes' threads and stack frames. The Dominator Tree provides information about keep-alive dependencies between objects. You can use regular expressions to filter the results these tools provide.</p> <p>Object Query Language studio is a MAT feature that allows you to query objects from the memory dump with an SQL-like language. The tool allows you to transform simple objects by invoking Java methods on them, and it provides an API for building sophisticated tools on top of the MAT.</p> <pre><code>SELECT * FROM java.lang.String\n</code></pre> <p>In the example above, all <code>String</code> objects present in the memory dump will be selected. The results will include the object's class, memory address, value, and retain count. To filter this information and see only the value of each string, use the following code:</p> <pre><code>SELECT toString(object) FROM java.lang.String object\n</code></pre> <p>Or</p> <pre><code>SELECT object.toString() FROM java.lang.String object\n</code></pre> <p>SQL supports primitive data types as well, so you can do something like the following to access the content of all <code>char</code> arrays:</p> <pre><code>SELECT toString(arr) FROM char[] arr\n</code></pre> <p>Don't be surprised if you get results that are similar to the previous results; after all, <code>String</code> and other Java data types are just wrappers around primitive data types. Now let's filter the results. The following sample code will select all byte arrays that contain the ASN.1 OID of an RSA key. This doesn't imply that a given byte array actually contains an RSA (the same byte sequence may be part of something else), but this is probable.</p> <pre><code>SELECT * FROM byte[] b WHERE toString(b).matches(\".*1\\.2\\.840\\.113549\\.1\\.1\\.1.*\")\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, you don't have to select whole objects. Consider an SQL analogy: classes are tables, objects are rows, and fields are columns. If you want to find all objects that have a \"password\" field, you can do something like the following:</p> <pre><code>SELECT password FROM \".*\" WHERE (null != password)\n</code></pre> <p>During your analysis, search for:</p> <ul> <li>Indicative field names: \"password\", \"pass\", \"pin\", \"secret\", \"private\", etc.</li> <li>Indicative patterns (e.g., RSA footprints) in strings, char arrays, byte arrays, etc.</li> <li>Known secrets (e.g., a credit card number that you've entered or an authentication token provided by the backend)</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul> <p>Repeating tests and memory dumps will help you obtain statistics about the length of data exposure.

This will make sure that a user needs to authenticate with biometrics (e.g. Face ID or Touch ID) before accessing the data in the keychain item.

After entering the domain, it will display the file, verify it for you and show the results (e.g. if it is not being properly served over HTTPS).

The \"appID\" should match the \"application-identifier\" key from the app\u2019s entitlements. Next, using the \"paths\" key, the developers can specify certain paths to be handled on a per app basis. Some apps, like Telegram use a standalone * (<code>\"paths\": [\"*\"]</code>) in order to allow all possible paths. Only if specific areas of the website should not be handled by some app, the developer can restrict access by excluding them by prepending a <code>\"NOT \"</code> (note the whitespace after the T) to the corresponding path. Also remember that the system will look for matches by following the order of the dictionaries in the array (first match wins).</p> <p>This path exclusion mechanism is not to be seen as a security feature but rather as a filter that developer might use to specify which apps open which links. By default, iOS does not open any unverified links.</p> <p>Remember that universal links verification occurs at installation time. iOS retrieves the AASA file for the declared domains (<code>applinks</code>) in its <code>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</code> entitlement. iOS will refuse to open those links if the verification did not succeed. Some reasons to fail verification might include:</p> <ul> <li>The AASA file is not served over HTTPS.</li> <li>The AASA is not available.</li> <li>The <code>appID</code>s do not match (this would be the case of a malicious app). iOS would successfully prevent any possible hijacking attacks.</li> </ul>","tags":["ios","MASVS-PLATFORM-1","MSTG-PLATFORM-4"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-PLATFORM/MASTG-TEST-0070/#checking-the-link-receiver-method","title":"Checking the Link Receiver Method","text":"<p>In order to receive links and handle them appropriately, the app delegate has to implement <code>application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:</code>.

Apple explicitly warns about this:</p> <p>Universal links offer a potential attack vector into your app, so make sure to validate all URL parameters and discard any malformed URLs. In addition, limit the available actions to those that do not risk the user\u2019s data. For example, do not allow universal links to directly delete content or access sensitive information about the user. When testing your URL-handling code, make sure your test cases include improperly formatted URLs.</p> <p>As stated in the Apple Developer Documentation, when iOS opens an app as the result of a universal link, the app receives an <code>NSUserActivity</code> object with an <code>activityType</code> value of <code>NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb</code>. The activity object\u2019s <code>webpageURL</code> property contains the HTTP or HTTPS URL that the user accesses. The following example in Swift verifies exactly this before opening the URL:</p> <pre><code>func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity,\n                 restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Bool {\n    // ...\n    if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb, let url = userActivity.webpageURL {\n        application.open(url, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)\n    }\n\n    return true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In addition, remember that if the URL includes parameters, they should not be trusted before being carefully sanitized and validated (even when coming from trusted domain). For example, they might have been spoofed by an attacker or might include malformed data. If that is the case, the whole URL and therefore the universal link request must be discarded.</p> <p>The <code>NSURLComponents</code> API can be used to parse and manipulate the components of the URL. This can be also part of the method <code>application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:</code> itself or might occur on a separate method being called from it. The following example demonstrates this:</p> <pre><code>func application(_ application: UIApplication,\n                 continue userActivity: NSUserActivity,\n                 restorationHandler: @escaping ([Any]?) -&gt; Void) -&gt; Bool {\n    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,\n        let incomingURL = userActivity.webpageURL,\n        let components = NSURLComponents(url: incomingURL, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true),\n        let path = components.path,\n        let params = components.queryItems else {\n        return false\n    }\n\n    if let albumName = params.first(where: { $0.name == \"albumname\" })?.value,\n        let photoIndex = params.first(where: { $0.name == \"index\" })?.value {\n        // Interact with album name and photo index\n\n        return true\n\n    } else {\n        // Handle when album and/or album name or photo index missing\n\n        return false\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, as stated above, be sure to verify that the actions triggered by the URL do not expose sensitive information or risk the user\u2019s data on any way.</p>","tags":["ios","MASVS-PLATFORM-1","MSTG-PLATFORM-4"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-PLATFORM/MASTG-TEST-0070/#checking-if-the-app-is-calling-other-apps-universal-links","title":"Checking if the App is Calling Other App's Universal Links","text":"<p>An app might be calling other apps via universal links in order to simply trigger some actions or to transfer information, in that case, it should be verified that it is not leaking sensitive information.</p> <p>If you have the original source code, you can search it for the <code>openURL:options: completionHandler:</code> method and check the data being handled.</p> <p>Note that the <code>openURL:options:completionHandler:</code> method is not only used to open universal links but also to call custom URL schemes.</p> <p>This is an example from the Telegram app:</p> <pre><code>}, openUniversalUrl: { url, completion in\n    if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {\n        var parsedUrl = URL(string: url)\n        if let parsed = parsedUrl {\n            if parsed.scheme == nil || parsed.scheme!.isEmpty {\n                parsedUrl = URL(string: \"https://\\(url)\")\n            }\n        }\n\n        if let parsedUrl = parsedUrl {\n            return UIApplication.shared.open(parsedUrl,\n                        options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionUniversalLinksOnly: true as NSNumber],\n                        completionHandler: { value in completion.completion(value)}\n            )\n</code></pre> <p>Note how the app adapts the <code>scheme</code> to \"https\" before opening it and how it uses the option <code>UIApplicationOpenURLOptionUniversalLinksOnly: true</code> that opens the URL only if the URL is a valid universal link and there is an installed app capable of opening that URL.</p> <p>If you don't have the original source code, search in the symbols and in the strings of the app binary.

All apps running on iOS version 5.1 and later should use these properties to exclude data from backups.</p> <p>The following is sample Objective-C code for excluding a file from a backup on iOS 5.1 and later:</p> <pre><code>- (BOOL)addSkipBackupAttributeToItemAtPath:(NSString *) filePathString\n{\n    NSURL* URL= [NSURL fileURLWithPath: filePathString];\n    assert([[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPath: [URL path]]);\n\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    BOOL success = [URL setResourceValue: [NSNumber numberWithBool: YES]\n                                  forKey: NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey error: &amp;error];\n    if(!success){\n        NSLog(@\"Error excluding %@ from backup %@\", [URL lastPathComponent], error);\n    }\n    return success;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The following is sample Swift code for excluding a file from a backup on iOS 5.1 and later, see Swift excluding files from iCloud backup for more information:</p> <pre><code>enum ExcludeFileError: Error {\n    case fileDoesNotExist\n    case error(String)\n}\n\nfunc excludeFileFromBackup(filePath: URL) -&gt; Result&lt;Bool, ExcludeFileError&gt; {\n    var file = filePath\n\n    do {\n        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: file.path) {\n            var res = URLResourceValues()\n            res.isExcludedFromBackup = true\n            try file.setResourceValues(res)\n            return .success(true)\n\n        } else {\n            return .failure(.fileDoesNotExist)\n        }\n    } catch {\n        return .failure(.error(\"Error excluding \\(file.lastPathComponent) from backup \\(error)\"))\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>","tags":["ios","MASVS-STORAGE-2","MSTG-STORAGE-8"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0058/#dynamic-analysis","title":"Dynamic Analysis","text":"<p>In order to test the backup, you obviously need to create one first. The most common way to create a backup of an iOS device is by using iTunes, which is available for Windows, Linux and of course macOS (till macOS Mojave). When creating a backup via iTunes you can always only backup the whole device and not select just a single app. Make sure that the option \"Encrypt local backup\" in iTunes is not set, so that the backup is stored in cleartext on your hard drive.</p> <p>iTunes is not available anymore from macOS Catalina onwards. Managing of an iOS device, including updates, backup and restore has been moved to the Finder app. The approach remains the same, as described above.</p> <p>After the iOS device has been backed up, you need to retrieve the file path of the backup, which are different locations on each OS. The official Apple documentation will help you to locate backups of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.</p> <p>When you want to navigate to the backup folder up to High Sierra you can easily do so. Starting with macOS Mojave you will get the following error (even as root):</p> <pre><code>$ pwd\n/Users/foo/Library/Application Support\n$ ls -alh MobileSync\nls: MobileSync: Operation not permitted\n</code></pre> <p>This is not a permission issue of the backup folder, but a new feature in macOS Mojave. You can solve this problem by granting full disk access to your terminal application by following the explanation on OSXDaily.</p> <p>Before you can access the directory you need to select the folder with the UDID of your device. Check the section \"Getting the UDID of an iOS device\" in the \"iOS Basic Security Testing\" chapter on how to retrieve the UDID.</p> <p>Once you know the UDID you can navigate into this directory and you will find the full backup of the whole device, which does include pictures, app data and whatever might have been stored on the device.</p> <p>Review the data that's in the backed up files and folders. The structure of the directories and file names is obfuscated and will look like this:</p> <pre><code>$ pwd\n/Users/foo/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/416f01bd160932d2bf2f95f1f142bc29b1c62dcb/00\n$ ls | head -n 3\n000127b08898088a8a169b4f63b363a3adcf389b\n0001fe89d0d03708d414b36bc6f706f567b08d66\n000200a644d7d2c56eec5b89c1921dacbec83c3e\n</code></pre> <p>Therefore, it's not straightforward to navigate through it and you will not find any hints of the app you want to analyze in the directory or file name. You can consider using the iMazing shareware utility to assist here. Perform a device backup with iMazing and use its built-in backup explorer to easily analyze app container contents including original paths and file names.</p> <p>Without iMazing or similar software you may need to resort to using grep to identify sensitive data. This is not the most thorough approach but you can try searching for sensitive data that you have keyed in while using the app before you made the backup. For example: the username, password, credit card data, PII or any data that is considered sensitive in the context of the app.</p> <pre><code>~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/&lt;UDID&gt;\ngrep -iRn \"password\" .\n</code></pre> <p>As described in the Static Analysis section, any sensitive data that you're able to find should be excluded from the backup, encrypted properly by using the Keychain or not stored on the device in the first place.</p> <p>To identify if a backup is encrypted, you can check the key named \"IsEncrypted\" from the file \"Manifest.plist\", located at the root of the backup directory. The following example shows a configuration indicating that the backup is encrypted:</p> <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;plist version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n...\n &lt;key&gt;Date&lt;/key&gt;\n &lt;date&gt;2021-03-12T17:43:33Z&lt;/date&gt;\n &lt;key&gt;IsEncrypted&lt;/key&gt;\n &lt;true/&gt;\n...\n&lt;/plist&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In case you need to work with an encrypted backup, there are some Python scripts in DinoSec's GitHub repo, such as backup_tool.py and backup_passwd.py, that will serve as a good starting point. However, note that they might not work with the latest iTunes/Finder versions and might need to be tweaked.</p> <p>You can also use the tool iOSbackup to easily read and extract files from a password-encrypted iOS backup.</p>","tags":["ios","MASVS-STORAGE-2","MSTG-STORAGE-8"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0058/#proof-of-concept-removing-ui-lock-with-tampered-backup","title":"Proof of Concept: Removing UI Lock with Tampered Backup","text":"<p>As discussed earlier, sensitive data is not limited to just user data and PII. It can also be configuration or settings files that affect app behavior, restrict functionality, or enable security controls. If you take a look at the open source bitcoin wallet app, Bither, you'll see that it's possible to configure a PIN to lock the UI. And after a few easy steps, you will see how to bypass this UI lock with a modified backup on a non-jailbroken device.</p> <p> </p> <p>After you enable the pin, use iMazing to perform a device backup:</p> <ol> <li>Select your device from the list under the AVAILABLE menu.</li> <li>Click the top menu option Back Up.</li> <li>Follow prompts to complete the backup using defaults.</li> </ol> <p>Next you can open the backup to view app container files within your target app:</p> <ol> <li>Select your device and click Backups on the top right menu.</li> <li>Click the backup you created and select View.</li> <li>Navigate to the Bither app from the Apps directory.</li> </ol> <p>At this point you can view all the backed up content for Bither.</p> <p></p> <p>This is where you can begin parsing through the files looking for sensitive data. In the screenshot you'll see the <code>net.bither.plist</code> file which contains the <code>pin_code</code> attribute. To remove the UI lock restriction, simply delete the <code>pin_code</code> attribute and save the changes.</p> <p>From there it's possible to easily restore the modified version of <code>net.bither.plist</code> back onto the device using the licensed version of iMazing.</p> <p>The free workaround, however, is to find the plist file in the obfuscated backup generated by iTunes/Finder. So create your backup of the device with Bither's PIN code configured. Then, using the steps described earlier, find the backup directory and grep for \"pin_code\" as shown below.</p> <pre><code>$ ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/&lt;UDID&gt;\n$ grep -iRn \"pin_code\" .\nBinary file ./13/135416dd5f251f9251e0f07206277586b7eac6f6 matches\n</code></pre> <p>You'll see there was a match on a binary file with an obfuscated name. This is your <code>net.bither.plist</code> file. Go ahead and rename the file giving it a plist extension so Xcode can easily open it up for you.</p> <p></p> <p>Again, remove the <code>pin_code</code> attribute from the plist and save your changes. Rename the file back to the original name (i.e., without the plist extension) and perform your backup restore. When the restore is complete you'll see that Bither no longer prompts you for the PIN code when launched.</p>","tags":["ios","MASVS-STORAGE-2","MSTG-STORAGE-8"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0060/","title":"MASTG-TEST-0060: Testing Memory for Sensitive Data","text":"","tags":["ios","MASVS-STORAGE-2","MSTG-STORAGE-10"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0060/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"","tags":["ios","MASVS-STORAGE-2","MSTG-STORAGE-10"]},{"location":"MASTG/tests/ios/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0060/#static-analysis","title":"Static Analysis","text":"<p>When performing static analysis for sensitive data exposed via memory, you should</p> <ul> <li>try to identify application components and map where the data is used,</li> <li>make sure that sensitive data is handled with as few components as possible,</li> <li>make sure that object references are properly removed once the object containing sensitive data is no longer needed,</li> <li>make sure that highly sensitive data is overwritten as soon as it is no longer needed,</li> <li>not pass such data via immutable data types, such as <code>String</code> and <code>NSString</code>,</li> <li>avoid non-primitive data types (because they might leave data behind),</li> <li>overwrite the value in memory before removing references,</li> <li>pay attention to third-party components (libraries and frameworks).

For this reason, we prioritize including tools that meet the following criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Open-source</li> <li>Free to use</li> <li>Capable of analyzing recent Android/iOS applications</li> <li>Regularly updated</li> <li>Strong community support</li> </ul> <p>In instances where no suitable open-source alternative exists, we may include closed-source tools. However, any closed-source tools included must be free to use, as we aim to avoid featuring paid tools whenever possible. This also extends to freeware or community editions of commercial tools.</p> <p>Our goal is to be vendor-neutral and to serve as a trusted learning resource, so the specific category of \"automated mobile application security scanners\" presents a unique challenge. For this reason, we have historically avoided including such tools due to the competitive disadvantages they can create among vendors. In contrast, we prioritize tools like MobSF that provide full access to their code and a comprehensive set of tests, making them excellent for educational purposes. Tools that lack this level of transparency, even if they offer a free version, generally do not meet the inclusion criteria of the OWASP MAS project.</p> <p>Disclaimer: Each tool included in the MASTG examples was verified to be functional at the time it was added. However, the tools may not work properly depending on the OS version of both your host computer and your test device. The functionality of the tools can also be affected by whether you're using a rooted or jailbroken device, the specific version of the rooting or jailbreaking method, and/or the tool version itself. The OWASP MASTG does not assume any responsibility for the operational status of these tools.

The module <code>app.package.attacksurface</code> lists activities, broadcast receivers, content providers and services that are exported, hence, they are public and can be accessed through other apps. Once we have identified our attack surface, we can interact with the IPC endpoints through drozer without having to write a separate standalone app as it would be required for certain tasks such as communicating with a content provider.</p> <p>For example, if the app has an exported Activity that leaks sensitive information we can invoke it with the Drozer module <code>app.activity.start</code>:</p> <pre><code>dz&gt; run app.activity.start --component &lt;package&gt; &lt;component name&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This previous command will start the activity, hopefully leaking some sensitive information.

Technically, it is an extended version of Zygote that exports APIs for running Java code when a new process is started. Running Java code in the context of the newly instantiated app makes it possible to resolve, hook, and override Java methods belonging to the app. Xposed uses reflection to examine and modify the running app. Changes are applied in memory and persist only during the process' runtime since the application binaries are not modified.</p> <p>To use Xposed, you need to first install the Xposed framework on a rooted device as explained on XDA-Developers Xposed framework hub. Modules can be installed through the Xposed Installer app, and they can be toggled on and off through the GUI.</p> <p>Note: given that a plain installation of the Xposed framework is easily detected with SafetyNet, we recommend using Magisk to install Xposed. This way, applications with SafetyNet attestation should have a higher chance of being testable with Xposed modules.</p> <p>Xposed has been compared to Frida. When you run Frida server on a rooted device, you will end up with a similarly effective setup. Both frameworks deliver a lot of value when you want to do dynamic instrumentation. When Frida crashes the app, you can try something similar with Xposed. Next, similar to the abundance of Frida scripts, you can easily use one of the many modules that come with Xposed, such as the earlier discussed module to bypass SSL pinning (JustTrustMe and SSLUnpinning).

For example, we might know that the app is verifying something, we can inspect all radare2 flags and see where we find something related to \"verify\".</p> <p>When loading a file, radare2 tags everything it's able to find. These tagged names or references are called flags.

Frida lets you execute snippets of JavaScript into native apps on Android and iOS (as well as on other platforms).</p> <p></p> <p>To install Frida locally, simply run:</p> <pre><code>pip install frida-tools\n</code></pre> <p>Or refer to the installation page for more details.</p> <p>Code can be injected in several ways. For example, Xposed permanently modifies the Android app loader, providing hooks for running your own code every time a new process is started. In contrast, Frida implements code injection by writing code directly into the process memory. When attached to a running app:</p> <ul> <li>Frida uses ptrace to hijack a thread of a running process. This thread is used to allocate a chunk of memory and populate it with a mini-bootstrapper.</li> <li>The bootstrapper starts a fresh thread, connects to the Frida debugging server that's running on the device, and loads a shared library that contains the Frida agent (<code>frida-agent.so</code>).</li> <li>The agent establishes a bi-directional communication channel back to the tool (e.g. the Frida REPL or your custom Python script).</li> <li>The hijacked thread resumes after being restored to its original state, and process execution continues as usual.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Frida Architecture, source: https://www.frida.re/docs/hacking/</li> </ul> <p>Frida offers three modes of operation:</p> <ol> <li>Injected: this is the most common scenario when frida-server is running as a daemon in the iOS or Android device. frida-core is exposed over TCP, listening on localhost:27042 by default. Running in this mode is not possible on devices that are not rooted or jailbroken.</li> <li>Embedded: this is the case when your device is not rooted nor jailbroken (you cannot use ptrace as an unprivileged user), you're responsible for the injection of the frida-gadget library by embedding it into your app, manually or via third-party tools such as Objection.</li> <li>Preloaded: similar to <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> or <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code>. You can configure the frida-gadget to run autonomously and load a script from the filesystem (e.g. path relative to where the Gadget binary resides).</li> </ol> <p>Independently of the chosen mode, you can make use of the Frida JavaScript APIs to interact with the running process and its memory. Some of the fundamental APIs are:</p> <ul> <li>Interceptor: When using the Interceptor API, Frida injects a trampoline (aka in-line hooking) at the function prologue which provokes a redirection to our custom code, executes our code, and returns to the original function. Note that while very effective for our purpose, this introduces a considerable overhead (due to the trampoline related jumping and context switching) and cannot be considered transparent as it overwrites the original code and acts similar to a debugger (putting breakpoints) and therefore can be detected in a similar manner, e.g. by applications that periodically checksum their own code.</li> <li>Stalker: If your tracing requirements include transparency, performance and high granularity, Stalker should be your API of choice. When tracing code with the Stalker API, Frida leverages just-in-time dynamic recompilation (by using Capstone): when a thread is about to execute its next instructions, Stalker allocates some memory, copies the original code over, and interlaces the copy with your custom code for instrumentation. Finally, it executes the copy (leaving the original code untouched, and therefore avoiding any anti-debugging checks). This approach increases instrumentation performance considerably and allows for very high granularity when tracing (e.g. by tracing exclusively CALL or RET instructions). You can learn more in-depth details in the blog post \"Anatomy of a code tracer\" by Frida's creator Ole [#vadla]. Some examples of use for Stalker are, for example who-does-it-call or diff-calls.</li> <li>Java: When working on Android you can use this API to enumerate loaded classes, enumerate class loaders, create and use specific class instances, enumerate live instances of classes by scanning the heap, etc.</li> <li>ObjC: When working on iOS you can use this API to get a mapping of all registered classes, register or use specific class or protocol instances, enumerate live instances of classes by scanning the heap, etc.</li> </ul> <p>Frida also provides a couple of simple tools built on top of the Frida API and available right from your terminal after installing frida-tools via pip. For instance:</p> <ul> <li>You can use the Frida CLI (<code>frida</code>) for quick script prototyping and try/error scenarios.</li> <li><code>frida-ps</code> to obtain a list of all apps (or processes) running on the device including their names, identifiers and PIDs.</li> <li><code>frida-ls-devices</code> to list your connected devices running Frida servers or agents.</li> <li><code>frida-trace</code> to quickly trace methods that are part of an iOS app or that are implemented inside an Android native library.</li> </ul> <p>In addition, you'll also find several open source Frida-based tools, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Grapefruit: a Runtime Application Instrument toolkig for iOS.</li> <li>Fridump: a memory dumping tool for both Android and iOS.</li> <li>Objection: a runtime mobile security assessment framework.</li> <li>r2frida: a project merging the powerful reverse engineering capabilities of radare2 with the dynamic instrumentation toolkit of Frida.</li> <li>jnitrace: a tool for tracing usage of the Android JNI runtime methods by a native library.</li> </ul> <p>We will be using all of these tools throughout the guide.</p> <p>You can use these tools as-is, tweak them to your needs, or take as excellent examples on how to use the APIs.

In this section, we will have walk-through on how to create a project, view disassembly and decompiled code for a binary.</p> <p>Start Ghidra using <code>ghidraRun</code> (*nix) or <code>ghidraRun.bat</code> (Windows), depending on the platform you are on. Once Ghidra is fired up, create a new project by specifying the project directory. You will be greeted by a window as shown below:</p> <p></p> <p>In your new Active Project you can import an app binary by going to File -&gt; Import File and choosing the desired file.</p> <p></p> <p>If the file can be properly processed, Ghidra will show meta-information about the binary before starting the analysis.</p> <p></p> <p>To get the disassembled code for the binary file chosen above, double click the imported file from the Active Project window. Click yes and analyze for auto-analysis on the subsequent windows. Auto-analysis will take some time depending on the size of the binary, the progress can be tracked in the bottom right corner of the code browser window. Once auto-analysis is completed you can start exploring the binary.</p> <p></p> <p>The most important windows to explore a binary in Ghidra are the Listing (Disassembly) window, the Symbol Tree window and the Decompiler window, which shows the decompiled version of the function selected for disassembly. The Display Function Graph option shows control flow graph of the selected function.</p> <p></p> <p>There are many other functionalities available in Ghidra and most of them can be explored by opening the Window menu. For example, if you want to examine the strings present in the binary, open the Defined Strings option. We will discuss other advanced functionalities while analyzing various binaries for Android and iOS platforms in the coming chapters.</p> <p></p>","tags":["generic"]},{"location":"MASTG/tools/generic/MASTG-TOOL-0034/","title":"MASTG-TOOL-0034: LIEF","text":"<p>The purpose of LIEF is to provide a cross platform library to parse, modify and abstract ELF, PE and MachO formats.

See the following script that simply runs the previous JavaScript snippet:</p> <pre><code># frida_python.py\nimport frida\n\nsession = frida.get_usb_device().attach('com.android.chrome')\n\nsource = \"\"\"\nJava.perform(function () {\n    var view = Java.use(\"android.view.View\");\n    var methods = view.class.getMethods();\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; methods.length; i++) {\n        console.log(methods[i].toString());\n    }\n});\n\"\"\"\n\nscript = session.create_script(source)\nscript.load()\n\nsession.detach()\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, running the Python script (<code>python3 frida_python.py</code>) has the same result as the previous example: it will print all methods of the <code>android.view.View</code> class to the terminal. However, you might want to work with that data from Python. Using <code>send</code> instead of <code>console.log</code> will send data in JSON format from JavaScript to Python. Please read the comments in the example below:</p> <pre><code># python3 frida_python_send.py\nimport frida\n\nsession = frida.get_usb_device().attach('com.android.chrome')\n\n# 1. we want to store method names inside a list\nandroid_view_methods = []\n\nsource = \"\"\"\nJava.perform(function () {\n    var view = Java.use(\"android.view.View\");\n    var methods = view.class.getMethods();\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; methods.length; i++) {\n        send(methods[i].toString());\n    }\n});\n\"\"\"\n\nscript = session.create_script(source)\n\n# 2. this is a callback function, only method names containing \"Text\" will be appended to the list\ndef on_message(message, data):\n    if \"Text\" in message['payload']:\n        android_view_methods.append(message['payload'])\n\n# 3. we tell the script to run our callback each time a message is received\nscript.on('message', on_message)\n\nscript.load()\n\n# 4. we do something with the collected data, in this case we just print it\nfor method in android_view_methods:\n    print(method)\n\nsession.detach()\n</code></pre> <p>This effectively filters the methods and prints only the ones containing the string \"Text\":</p> <pre><code>$ python3 frida_python_send.py\npublic boolean android.view.View.canResolveTextAlignment()\npublic boolean android.view.View.canResolveTextDirection()\npublic void android.view.View.setTextAlignment(int)\npublic void android.view.View.setTextDirection(int)\npublic void android.view.View.setTooltipText(java.lang.CharSequence)\n...\n</code></pre> <p>In the end, it is up to you to decide where would you like to work with the data.

It provides a graphical user interface and a version of the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT). You can easily access many \"unsanctioned\" app packages through Cydia. Most jailbreaks install Cydia automatically.</p> <p>Many tools on a jailbroken device can be installed by using Cydia, which is the unofficial AppStore for iOS devices and allows you to manage repositories. In Cydia you should add (if not already done by default) the following repositories by navigating to Sources -&gt; Edit, then clicking Add in the top left:</p> <ul> <li>http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia/: One of the most popular repositories is BigBoss, which contains various packages, such as the BigBoss Recommended Tools package.</li> <li>https://cydia.akemi.ai/: Add \"Karen's Repo\" to get the AppSync package.</li> <li>https://build.frida.re: Install Frida by adding the repository to Cydia.</li> <li>https://repo.chariz.io: Useful when managing your jailbreak on iOS 11.</li> <li>https://apt.bingner.com/: Another repository, with quiet a few good tools, is Elucubratus, which gets installed when you install Cydia on iOS 12 using Unc0ver.</li> </ul> <p>In case you are using the Sileo App Store, please keep in mind that the Sileo Compatibility Layer shares your sources between Cydia and Sileo, however, Cydia is unable to remove sources added in Sileo, and Sileo is unable to remove sources added in Cydia. Keep this in mind when you\u2019re trying to remove sources.</p> <p>After adding all the suggested repositories above you can install the following useful packages from Cydia to get started:</p> <ul> <li>adv-cmds: Advanced command line, which includes tools such as finger, fingerd, last, lsvfs, md, and ps.</li> <li>AppList: Allows developers to query the list of installed apps and provides a preference pane based on the list.</li> <li>Apt: Advanced Package Tool, which you can use to manage the installed packages similarly to DPKG, but in a more friendly way. This allows you to install, uninstall, upgrade, and downgrade packages from your Cydia repositories. Comes from Elucubratus.</li> <li>AppSync Unified: Allows you to sync and install unsigned iOS applications.</li> <li>BigBoss Recommended Tools: Installs many useful command line tools for security testing including standard Unix utilities that are missing from iOS, including wget, unrar, less, and sqlite3 client.</li> <li>class-dump: A command line tool for examining the Objective-C runtime information stored in Mach-O files and generating header files with class interfaces.</li> <li>class-dump-z: A command line tool for examining the Swift runtime information stored in Mach-O files and generating header files with class interfaces. This is not available via Cydia, therefore please refer to installation steps in order to get class-dump-z running on your iOS device. Note that class-dump-z is not maintained and does not work well with Swift. It is recommended to use dsdump instead.</li> <li>Clutch: Used to decrypt an app executable.</li> <li>Cycript: Is an inlining, optimizing, Cycript-to-JavaScript compiler and immediate-mode console environment that can be injected into running processes (associated to Substrate).</li> <li>Cydia Substrate: A platform that makes developing third-party iOS add-ons easier via dynamic app manipulation or introspection.</li> <li>cURL: Is a well known http client which you can use to download packages faster to your device. This can be a great help when you need to install different versions of Frida-server on your device for instance.</li> <li>Darwin CC Tools: A useful set of tools like nm, and strip that are capable of auditing mach-o files.</li> <li>IPA Installer Console: Tool for installing IPA application packages from the command line. After installing two commands will be available <code>installipa</code> and <code>ipainstaller</code> which are both the same.</li> <li>Frida: An app you can use for dynamic instrumentation. Please note that Frida has changed its implementation of its APIs over time, which means that some scripts might only work with specific versions of the Frida-server (which forces you to update/downgrade the version also on macOS). Running Frida Server installed via APT or Cydia is recommended. Upgrading/downgrading afterwards can be done, by following the instructions of this Github issue.</li> <li>Grep: Handy tool to filter lines.</li> <li>Gzip: A well known ZIP utility.</li> <li>PreferenceLoader: A Substrate-based utility that allows developers to add entries to the Settings application, similar to the SettingsBundles that App Store apps use.</li> <li>SOcket CAT: a utility with which you can connect to sockets to read and write messages. This can come in handy if you want to trace the syslog on iOS 12 devices.</li> </ul> <p>Besides Cydia you can also ssh into your iOS device and you can install the packages directly via apt-get, like for example adv-cmds.</p> <pre><code>apt-get update\napt-get install adv-cmds\n</code></pre>","tags":["ios"]},{"location":"MASTG/tools/ios/MASTG-TOOL-0048/","title":"MASTG-TOOL-0048: dsdump","text":"<p>dsdump is a tool to dump Objective-C classes and Swift type descriptors (classes, structs, enums).

Less than a decade ago, smartphones were clunky devices with little keyboards - expensive playthings for tech-savvy business users. Today, smartphones are an essential part of our lives. We've come to rely on them for information, navigation and communication, and they are ubiquitous both in business and in our social lives.</p> <p>Every new technology introduces new security risks, and keeping up with those changes is one of the main challenges the security industry faces. The defensive side is always a few steps behind. For example, the default reflex for many was to apply old ways of doing things: Smartphones are like small computers, and mobile apps are just like classic software, so surely the security requirements are similar? But it doesn't work like that. Smartphone operating systems are different from desktop operating systems, and mobile apps are different from web apps. For example, the classical method of signature-based virus scanning doesn't make sense in modern mobile OS environments: Not only is it incompatible with the mobile app distribution model, it's also technically impossible due to sandboxing restrictions. Also, some vulnerability classes, such as buffer overflows and XSS issues, are less relevant in the context of run-of-the-mill mobile apps than in, say, desktop apps and web applications (exceptions apply).</p> <p>Over time, our industry has gotten a better grip on the mobile threat landscape. As it turns out, mobile security is all about data protection: Apps store our personal information, pictures, recordings, notes, account data, business information, location and much more. They act as clients that connect us to services we use on a daily basis, and as communications hubs that processes each and every message we exchange with others. Compromise a person's smartphone and you get unfiltered access to that person's life. When we consider that mobile devices are more readily lost or stolen and mobile malware is on the rise, the need for data protection becomes even more apparent.</p> <p>A security standard for mobile apps must therefore focus on how mobile apps handle, store and protect sensitive information. Even though modern mobile operating systems like iOS and Android offer mature APIs for secure data storage and communication, those have to be implemented and used correctly in order to be effective. Data storage, inter-app communication, proper usage of cryptographic APIs and secure network communication are only some of the aspects that require careful consideration.</p> <p>An important question in need of industry consensus is how far exactly one should go in protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data. For example, most of us would agree that a mobile app should verify the server certificate in a TLS exchange. But what about certificate or public key pinning? Does not doing it result in a vulnerability? Should this be a requirement if an app handles sensitive data, or is it maybe even counter-productive? Do we need to encrypt data stored in SQLite databases, even though the OS sandboxes the app? What is appropriate for one app might be unrealistic for another. The MASVS is an attempt to standardize these requirements using profiles that fit different threat scenarios.</p> <p>Furthermore, the appearance of root malware and remote administration tools has created awareness of the fact that mobile operating systems themselves have exploitable flaws, so containerization strategies are increasingly used to afford additional protection to sensitive data and prevent client-side tampering. This is where things get complicated. Hardware- backed security features and OS-level containerization solutions, such as Android Enterprise and Samsung Knox, do exist, but they aren't consistently available across different devices. As a band aid, it is possible to implement software-based protection measures - but unfortunately, there are no standards or testing processes for verifying these kinds of protections.</p> <p>As a result, mobile app security testing reports are all over the place: For example, some testers report a lack of obfuscation or root detection in an Android app as \u201csecurity flaw\u201d. On the other hand, measures like string encryption, debugger detection or control flow obfuscation aren't considered mandatory. However, this binary way of looking at things doesn't make sense because resilience is not a binary proposition: It depends on the particular client-side threats one aims to defend against. Software protections are not useless, but they can ultimately be bypassed, so they must never be used as a replacement for security controls.</p> <p>The overall goal of the MASVS is to offer a baseline for mobile application security, while also allowing for the inclusion of defense-in-depth measures and protections against client-side threats. The MASVS is meant to achieve the following:</p> <ul> <li>Provide requirements for software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications;</li> <li>Offer an industry standard that can be tested against in mobile app security reviews;</li> <li>Clarify the role of software protection mechanisms in mobile security and provide requirements to verify their effectiveness;</li> <li>Provide specific recommendations as to what level of security is recommended for different use-cases.</li> </ul> <p>We are aware that 100% industry consensus is impossible to achieve. Nevertheless, we hope that the MASVS is useful in providing guidance throughout all phases of mobile app development and testing. As an open source standard, the MASVS will evolve over time, and we welcome any contributions and suggestions.</p> <p>By Bernhard Mueller</p>","tags":[]},{"location":"MASVS/02-Frontispiece/","title":"About the Standard","text":"<p>The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is the industry standard for mobile application security.

The sheer range techniques and possible specializations is mind-blowing: One can spend years working on a very specific, isolated sub-problem, such as automating malware analysis or developing novel de-obfuscation methods. For mobile app security testers, it can be challenging to filter through the vast amount of information and build a working methodology. Things become even more problematic when one is tasked to assess apps that are heavily obfuscated and have anti-tampering measures built in.</p> <p>One of the main goals in the MSTG is to build the ultimate resource for mobile reverse engineers. This includes not only basic static and dynamic analysis, but also advanced de-obfuscation, scripting and automation. Obviously, writing all this content is a lot of work, both in terms of general content and OS-specific how-tos. We're therefore looking for talented authors that want to join the project early on. Topics include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Basic Hybrid Static/Dynamic Analysis</li> <li>Code Injection and Dynamic Instrumentation (Substrate, FRIDA)</li> <li>Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (Valgrind, PIE)</li> <li>Analysis Frameworks (Metasm / Miasm)</li> <li>Symbolic Execution</li> <li>DCA and DPA attacks on white-box crypto</li> <li>Dynamic analysis frameworks (PANDA / DroidScope,...)</li> <li>Anything else we might have missed</li> </ul>","tags":[]},{"location":"news/2016/12/04/call-for-authors-the-ultimate-open-source-mobile-app-reverse-engineering-guide/#what-is-in-for-me","title":"What is in for me?","text":"<p>All of this is unpaid, volunteer work.

The new version 1.2 is available in Github Releases: https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/tag/v1.2. For more details please look into our Release Notes for Version 1.2 and Version 1.2-RC https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mastg/releases/tag/v1.2.</p> <p>Thanks to the great support of our community we have now 9 different languages available in total for the MASVS and would like to thank all of our translators for their great work and support throughout:</p> <ul> <li>Chinese (traditional) - Peter Chi, Lex Chien, Henry Hu and Leo Wang</li> <li>Chinese (simplified) - Bob Peng, Harold Zang and Jack S</li> <li>English - Jeroen Willemsen, Sven Schleier, Carlos Holguera and Jeroen Beckers</li> <li>French - Romuald Szkudlarek, Abderrahmane Aftahi and Christian Dong (Review)</li> <li>German - Rocco Gr\u00e4nitz and Sven Schleier</li> <li>Japanese - Koki Takeyama and Riotaro Okada (Review)</li> <li>Korean - Youngjae Jeon, Jeongwon Cho, Jiyou Han and Jiyeon Sung</li> <li>Russian - Eugen Martynov, Gall Maxim, Chelnokov Vladislav (Review), Oprya Egor (Review) and Tereshin Dmitry (Review)</li> <li>Spanish - Martin Marsicano and Carlos Holguera</li> </ul> <p>The MASVS and its translations are available in PDF, Mobile, ePub, docx and you can also read it via Gitbook.

This will make it easier for users to understand the standard and implement it effectively in their own projects.</li> <li>Bring Clarity: we have worked hard to use standard terminology wherever possible, drawing on established sources such as NIST-SP 800-175B and NIST OSCAL, as well as well-known and used sources such as CWEs, Android Developer Docs, and Apple Docs.</li> <li>Narrow Scope: we have narrowed the scope of MASVS to rely more heavily on other industry standards such as the OWASP ASVS, OWASP SAMM and NIST.SP.800-218 SSDF v1.1.

For example, if an app collects data that it didn't mention in the app store or its privacy policy, it takes careful manual checking to spot this.</p> <p>The new controls are:</p> <ul> <li>MASVS-PRIVACY-1: The app minimizes access to sensitive data and resources.</li> <li>MASVS-PRIVACY-2: The app prevents identification of the user.</li> <li>MASVS-PRIVACY-3: The app is transparent about data collection and usage.</li> <li>MASVS-PRIVACY-4: The app offers user control over their data.</li> </ul>","tags":[]},{"location":"news/2024/01/18/masvs-v210-release--masvs-privacy/#cyclonedx-support","title":"CycloneDX Support","text":"<p>The MASVS is now available in CycloneDX format (OWASP_MASVS.cdx.json), a widely adopted standard for software bill of materials (SBOM).

Tailored for local app developers and service providers, this guideline is based on the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) and focuses on critical areas such as authentication and authorization (MASVS-AUTH), data storage (MASVS-STORAGE), and tamper resistance (MASVS-RESILIENCE). The initiative aims to protect apps from common cyber threats and ensure a safer digital space for users.</p> <p>While the Safe App Standard is a significant step forward in securing mobile applications, developers are encouraged to consider the full MASVS and select the appropriate MAS profiles for comprehensive protection. This holistic approach to app security ensures that apps go beyond meeting the baseline and are protected against a wider range of cyber threats, providing robust security for end users.</p> <p> </p>","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2023/","title":"2023","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2022/","title":"2022","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2021/","title":"2021","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2020/","title":"2020","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2019/","title":"2019","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2018/","title":"2018","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2017/","title":"2017","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2016/","title":"2016","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/page/2/","title":"Blog","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/page/3/","title":"Blog","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/page/4/","title":"Blog","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/page/5/","title":"Blog","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/page/6/","title":"Blog","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2019/page/2/","title":"2019","text":"","tags":[]},{"location":"news/archive/2018/page/2/","title":"2018","text":"","tags":[]}]}
